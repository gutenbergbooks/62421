<small>THE HOUSEBREAKER.</small></h2>


<p>In one of the residence streets of Gold Hill, Arizona,
stood—and no doubt still stands at this moment—a rather
pretentious, two-story dwelling. Six low-growing, broad-leaved
palms were marshaled in two rows before the
front door, and to right and left of the palms were
umbrella and pepper trees. Extending from one corner
of the house, almost to the pickets that fenced in the
premises, was a rank growth of oleanders.</p>

<p>This was the home of Colonel Alvah G. Hawtrey, an
ex-army officer. In the service of his country Hawtrey
had chased and fought the murderous Apaches all over
that part of the Southwest; and now, at the age of sixty,
the colonel, with an honorable discharge from the service,
was giving his attention to various mining enterprises and
was reputed to be a very wealthy man.</p>

<p>He was broad-minded and public-spirited, and the
prosperity of Gold Hill owed more to the old colonel
than to any other citizen. He had built the Bristow
Hotel and several brick business blocks; he had founded
a social club, a cattlemen’s association, and a miners’ relief
society. It was known that he paid, out of his own
pocket, the salary of one of the local ministers; he owned
a bank, and, last but not least, he had organized and
brought into successful operation the Gold Hill Athletic
Club. For nothing was the colonel more honored than
for his love of manly sports, and for his zeal in seeing<span class="pagenum" id="Page_6">6</span>
that the youth of Gold Hill received proper physical
training.</p>

<p>On a night in late October a spectral figure crept along
the fence in front of Colonel Hawtrey’s house. The
house was dark, and apparently deserted. After surveying
the house carefully for a few moments, the figure
leaped the fence noiselessly and gracefully and faded
into the deep shadow of the oleanders.</p>

<p>Very carefully the prowler made his way through the
bushes to the corner of the house. Here again he paused
and listened. Seemingly satisfied that the coast was
clear, he glided to the nearest window, opened the thin
blade of a pocketknife, climbed to the sill, forced the
blade between the upper and lower sash, and deftly
opened the lock. Another moment and he had raised
the lower half of the window and dropped through into
the dark room beyond.</p>

<p>Evidently this prowler was not on unfamiliar ground.
Without striking a light, he groped his way to a door
and into a hall; through the hall he passed, and to a
stairway, then up the stairs to the hall above, and down
the corridor to a room at the rear of the house. He had
a key to the door of the room, and he opened it. Once
across the threshold, he scratched a match, stepped to
an electric-light button, and touched it with his finger.
Instantly the room was flooded with a glow of light from
incandescent bulbs.</p>

<p>It was a small room, with banners and pennants on the
walls. Several of the flags bore the letters, “G.  H.  H.  S.”—official
emblems of Gold Hill “High.” Others bore the
initials “G.  H.  A.  C.” and had once figured in athletic-club
events. Foils were also crossed on the wall, boxing
gloves hung from pegs, a catcher’s mask lay on a shelf,
and a breast protector hung beneath it. On the same<span class="pagenum" id="Page_7">7</span>
shelf with the mask stood a tarnished silver cup, bearing
an inscription to the effect that it had been presented
to one Ellis Darrel for winning a two-hundred-and-twenty-yard
dash under the auspices of the Gold Hill
Athletic Club. Dumb-bells and Indian clubs stood on the
floor close to the wall.</p>

<p>Thick dust covered everything. The prowler stood in
the center of the room as though in a trance, and slowly
allowed his eyes to wander about him.</p>

<p>He was a young fellow, not much over seventeen,
slender and with a body remarkably well set-up. His
hair was light and curly, his eyes blue, and his face was
handsome and winning, although clouded with melancholy
and a certain haunting sadness.</p>

<p>The long, wavering survey of the room seemed to overcome
the intruder. Suddenly he sank down into a dusty
morris chair, bowed his head, and covered his face with
his hands. As suddenly, he roused himself again, shook
his shoulders as though to free them of a grievous burden,
and made his way toward the door of a closet.</p>

<p>From the closet he removed a suit case, lettered with
the initials “E.  D.,” and followed with the address, “Gold
Hill, Ariz.” Kneeling beside the bit of luggage, he
opened it and took out a sleeveless shirt, a pair of running
pants, and a pair of spiked shoes. A couple of
cork grips rattled around in the suit case as he removed
the other contents, but he left them, closed the grip, and
returned it to the closet. Then he carefully closed the
closet door.</p>

<p>Rolling his sprinting outfit into a compact bundle, the
intruder rose to his feet and started for the hall door.
On his way he paused. Below the cross foils hung a
picture, turned with its face to the wall.</p>

<p>A flash of white ran through the lad’s bronzed cheeks.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_8">8</span>
With his bundle under his arm, he put out one trembling
hand to the picture and turned it around.</p>

<p>It was a framed photograph of a young fellow in running
costume, taken on a cinder path. The lad in the
photo was holding a silver cup—the same cup that stood
on the shelf in that room. And it was more than evident
that the youngster in the picture was the very
same lad who had entered that house like a thief in
the night, and was now staring at a kodak testimonial of
a former track victory.</p>

<p>Why was the photograph turned to the wall? Why
was the dust lying thick upon every object in the room?
The cause was no mystery to the intruder. His lip
quivered and a mist rose in his eyes as he turned the
photograph to the wall once more.</p>

<p>He peered around to make sure that he had left nothing
which might prove a clew to his presence in the
room, then turned off the light, passed into the hall, and
shut and locked the door behind him. As he had come
gropingly to the upper floor, so now he felt his way down
the stairs and to the opened window. To climb through
the window and lower the sash from the outside required
but a few moments.</p>

<p>He tried to relock the sash, but found it impossible.
Hesitating a moment by the unlocked window, he turned
finally and made his way through the oleanders to the
fence; then, leaping the pickets as he had done before, he
vanished along the gloomy street.</p>

<p>He had come from Nowhere, this mysterious lad who
had come prowling by night into the house of Colonel
Hawtrey; but he was going Somewhere, and, for the
first time in months, he had a destination and a fixed
object in mind. Although he believed that he had left<span class="pagenum" id="Page_9">9</span>
no clews behind him, and that he had not been seen coming
or going from the house, yet he was mistaken.</p>

<p>Some one, leaving the dwelling by the front door, had
passed along the walk between the shadowy palms just
at the moment the intruder was standing by the fence.
At the very moment the prowler leaped the pickets, this
other person was at the gate and had caught sight of
the figure disappearing into the oleanders.</p>

<p>The person who had left the house repressed a cry of
alarm and stood, for a few moments, leaning over the
gatepost. It had seemed to him as though, in the starlight,
he had recognized the form that had leaped the
fence. A gasp escaped his tense lips, and it was plain
that he was gripped hard with astonishment and dismay.
While he stood there, slowly recovering control of
himself, he heard muffled sounds from within the house;
then, leaving the gate, he passed through the oleander
bushes and found the open window. He was on the point
of following the intruder into the house when a glow of
light shone out from the second floor. Hurrying to a
pepper tree that grew near a rear corner of the building,
the spy climbed swiftly upward until he was on a
level with the window through which came the light.
The prowler had not drawn the shade, so all that went
on in the upper room came under the eyes of the spy.</p>

<p>One look at the lad in the house, under the electric
light, convinced the person in the tree that the prowler
was really the one whom he had at first supposed him
to be. The spy gritted his teeth and his hands clutched
the tree limbs convulsively. When the intruder had left
the house and vanished down the street, the spy came
down from the tree, hurried around to the front door,
and let himself into the building. Quickly he turned on
the lights and made his way to the room, through the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_10">10</span>
window of which the intruder had gained entrance into
the house.</p>

<p>This room was the colonel’s study. A desk stood in
the center of it, the walls were lined with books, and in
one corner was a massive iron safe.</p>

<p>In the light it could be seen that this second youth
was not more than two years the senior of the lad who
had come and gone. But the face of this second youth
was dark and sinister, and the puzzled light in his shifty
eyes was gradually taking on a cunning gleam.</p>

<p>“What is he back here for?” he was asking himself,
half aloud. “Just getting his old running suit, eh?” and
there was something of a sneer in the voice. “There’s
money in the safe, and I thought——” Just what the
lad thought did not appear. A look at the safe showed
it had not been tampered with. “Has he returned to
soft soap the old gent and get back into his good graces?
That’s what he has on his mind, and I’ll bet on it! He
stole in here like a thief—just to get his old track clothes!
I wonder——”</p>

<p>The youth paused, the cunning light growing in his
eyes. On the floor, below the window, lay an open
pocketknife. He picked it up and looked at it. On a
piece of worn silver in the handle was marked, “E.  D.,
from Uncle Alvah.”</p>

<p>“By Jupiter,” whispered the lad, “I’ll do it! Here’s
a chance to cinch the situation—for me. I can make
it impossible for that soft-sawdering beggar to get back
into Uncle Alvah’s confidence. I’ll fix him, by thunder!”</p>

<p>Swiftly the schemer darted to the safe. Kneeling before
it, he turned the knob of the combination back and
forth for a few moments, and then pulled open the heavy
door. The inner door was drawn out easily, and a package
of bills, wound with a paper band and marked<span class="pagenum" id="Page_11">11</span>
“$1,000” was removed. The boy hesitated, the package
of bills in his hand.</p>

<p>“Hang it,” he muttered, “it’s now or never. There’s
nothing else for it!”</p>

<p>With that, he pushed the bills into his pocket and
got up.</p>

<p>“It will look like a clear case,” he went on. “The old
gent will come here to-morrow morning, find the safe
open, the window unlocked, the money gone—<em>and Darrel’s
knife on the floor</em>! I’ll bet a row of ’dobies,” he
added fiercely, “that will fix Darrel for good. What did
he want to come back here for, anyhow? He ought to
have had better sense. Lucky thing I had to run into
town from Mohave Cañon, in order to fix up a scheme
to knock Frank Merriwell out; and it’s lucky I was leaving
the house and saw Darrel, and spied on him instead
of giving a yell and facing him down. Oh, I reckon
things are coming my way, all right! But Darrel—here!
Who’d have dreamed of such a thing? There’ll be merry
blazes when the old gent gets home to-morrow!”</p>

<p>Chuckling to himself, the plotter put out the lights,
made his way to the front door, and was soon clear of
the house and in the street. He had laid an evil train
of circumstantial evidence, designed to benefit himself at
the expense of Darrel.</p>

<small>A STRANGER IN CAMP.</small></h2>


<p>Frank Merriwell, junior, and his two chums, Owen
Clancy and Billy Ballard, were camping at Tinaja Wells
with the football squad of the Ophir Athletic Club. Besides
Frank and his friends there were fifteen campers
in the grove at the Wells, enumerated by Ballard as one
professor, one Mexican, one Dutchman, and twelve
knights of the pigskin.</p>

<p>The professor was Phineas Borrodaile. He hailed
originally from a prep school in the middle West, had
come to Arizona for his health, and, aided by the two
Merriwells, senior and junior, had found wealth as well.
The professor was now being retained as instructor by
young Frank and his chums, thus enabling them to keep
up with their studies while “roughing it” in the Southwest.</p>

<p>The Mexican was Silva, the packer. Silva had a
burro train, and had packed the equipment of the campers
over the fifteen miles separating Ophir from Tinaja
Wells. For ten miles the trail was a good wagon road;
but from Dolliver’s, at the mouth of Mohave Cañon, up
the cañon to Tinaja Wells, the trail was a mere bridle
path, and only pack animals could get over it. Hence
the lads had found it necessary to make use of Silva and
his burros.</p>

<p>The Mexican had hired out as cook, as well as packer;
but two days of Silva’s red-hot Mexican cooking, with
garlic trimmings, made it necessary for the boys either
to line themselves with asbestos or get another cook.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_13">13</span>
Clancy was sent in to Ophir and he came back with Fritz
Gesundheit, the Dutchman. Fritz had presided over a
chuck shanty in the cattle country, and carried recommendations
which highly extolled his sour-dough bread,
flap jacks, and crullers.</p>

<p>Fritz was nearly as broad as he was high, but he
proved a chef of rare attainments. He would roll around
between the stove and the chuck tent, and play an errorless
game in his cooking and serving; but let him waddle
out of his culinary environment and he was as full of
blunders as a porcupine is of quills. For a lot of skylarking
boys, he was an everlasting joy and a perpetual
delight.</p>

<p>Silva resented the loss of his cooking job. He burned
to revenge himself on the fat <i lang ="es-mx">gringo chingado</i> who had
kicked the red peppers and the garlic out of camp and
preëmpted the culinary department. Less than an hour
after Fritz had evolved his first meal for the campers
and covered himself with glory, the Mexican’s dark plots
came to a head. Placing the professor’s mule, Uncle
Sam, between two clumps of cholla cactus, he smilingly
invited Fritz to take a ride.</p>

<p>“Carrots,” as Fritz had instantly been christened by
the lads on account of his hair, accepted the invitation
and climbed to Uncle Sam’s hurricane deck. Thereupon
the vengeful Silva twisted Uncle Sam’s tail with direful
results. Carrots made a froglike leap over the mule’s
head into one clump of cactus, and Silva, caught by the
mule’s heels before he could get out of the way, sat down
in another clump.</p>

<p>The campers were not long in finding out that Carrots
was the subject of weird hallucinations. His latest
delusion concerned buried treasure. It cropped out in
the afternoon of his second day in camp. Merry had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
taken the football players out for a “breather”—down
the cañon to Dolliver’s, and back. Silva was out with
a shovel and hornspoon, somewhere in the hills, hunting
a placer, and incidentally nursing his grievances. The
professor was reading in the shade of a cottonwood. In
the shade of another cottonwood, Carrots was mooning
over a pipe of tobacco.</p>

<p>“Brofessor,” called the Dutchman, knocking the ashes
out of his pipe and putting it carefully away in his pocket,
“vill you told me someding?”</p>

<p>The professor looked up from his book and over his
spectacles at Fritz.</p>

<p>“What is it that you desire to know?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Ask me dot.”</p>

<p>The professor showed signs of impatience.</p>

<p>“Simpleton! Am I not putting the query? What
shall I tell you?”</p>

<p>“Py chiminy Grismus! Oof I know vat you vas to
told me, for vy should I make der rekvest for informations?”</p>

<p>Borrodaile gave a grunt of disgust and hunted the
shade of another cottonwood. Fritz was persistent, however,
and followed him up.</p>

<p>“I hat a tream mit meinselluf der oder night, brofessor,”
continued Fritz, coming up from behind, “und
you bed my life it vas der keveerest tream vat I know.
Iss treams someding or nodding? Tell me dot, oof you
blease. Ballard, he say it iss; aber you know more as
anypody, so tell me, iss it?”</p>

<p>“Go away,” said the professor severely; “you annoy
me.”</p>

<p>“I peen annoyed like anyding mit dot tream,” went
on Fritz, not in the least disturbed by the professor’s ill
humor.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span> “Dis iss der vay I ged it: Fairst, I valk along
der moonlight in, mit der dark around, und I see a
shtone mit a gross on der top. Yah, so hellup me, I see
him so blain as nodding; und I pull oop dot shtone, und
I tig, and vat you dink?”</p>

<p>“I am not interested at all in your foolish delusions!”
came tartly from the professor. “If you have business
anywhere else, do not let me detain you a moment.”</p>

<p>“Make some guesses aboudt dot!” persisted Fritz. “Vat
you dink is der shtone under mit der gross on, hey?
Shpeak it oudt.”</p>

<p>The professor, goaded to desperation, merely glared.</p>

<p>“Py shinks!” cried Fritz, “I findt me so mooch goldt
dot shtone under mit der gross on dot I cannot carry
him avay!” He leaned down and whispered huskily, his
eyes wide with excitement: “Puried dreasure it vas, brofessor,
so hellup me! Come, blease, und hellup me look
for der shtone mit der gross on. Ven I findt me der
dreasure, I gif you haluf.”</p>

<p>With an explosion of anger, the professor leaped to
his feet, flung his book at Fritz, and dove head-first into
a tent. Fritz turned away wonderingly.</p>

<p>“Vat a foolishness,” he muttered, “for der brofessor
to gif oop haluf der dreasure like dot! Vell, I go look
for der goldt meinselluf, und ven I findt him, I haf him
all.”</p>

<p>Now, Fritz might have walked his legs off looking for
a stone “mit a gross on,” had not Silva grown tired of
hunting a placer and returned suddenly to the Wells.
He saw Fritz in close converse with the professor, crept
to a point within earshot, and listened. Creeping away
as silently as he had approached, he showed his teeth
in a smile of savage cunning as he pulled a half-burned
stick from the smoldering fire and dogged the Dutchman
down the gulch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span></p>

<p>Apparently there was not a doubt in the mind of Fritz
but that he would find what he was looking for. With
a shovel over his shoulder, he puffed, and wheezed, and
stumbled along the trail, eying the rocks on each side of
him and singing as he went.</p>

<p>Silva, chuckling with unholy glee, made a detour from
the trail and got back into it ahead of Fritz; and then,
with the burned stick, he marked a rough cross on one
of the bowlders and retired behind a screen of mesquite
bushes to enjoy the sight of his fat enemy, working and
sweating to such little purpose.</p>

<p>When Fritz saw that marked rock, he let go a howl
of delight and triumph that echoed far down the cañon.
It reached the ears of Merry and his friends, who, in
their running clothes, were strung out in a long line on
their way back from Dolliver’s.</p>

<p>The lads halted, bunched together, and made up their
minds that the noise they had heard should be investigated.
Proceeding cautiously forward, they peered
around a ridge of bowlders and saw Fritz digging into
the hard ground like mad. So feverishly did the fat
Dutchman work that one could hardly see him for the
cloud of sand and gravel he kept in the air.</p>

<p>Not more than ten feet away from the sweating Fritz
was the Mexican, Silva. He was in a flutter of delight.</p>

<p>“What the deuce is going on, Chip?” inquired Clancy.</p>

<p>“I can tell you, Clan,” spoke up Ballard, stifling a
laugh. “Fritz had a dream last night that he found a
rock with a cross on it, and that he rolled away the
rock, dug up the ground, and found more gold than
he could carry. He told me about it. I’ll bet a farm
he thinks he’s found the rock. Silva’s in on the deal
somewhere, although Carrots doesn’t know it.”</p>

<p>“This is rich!” gulped Hannibal Bradlaugh, shaking<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
with the fun of it. “Say, Chip, can’t you ring in a little
twist to the situation and turn the tables on the greaser?”</p>

<p>“Throw your voice, Chip!” suggested Clan. “Make
Carrots think he’s digging up more than he bargained
for. Go on!”</p>

<p>“All right,” laughed Merry. “Let’s see what happens.”</p>

<p>The boys, caught at once with the idea, suppressed
their delight, and peered over the top and sides of the
ridge. Suddenly a nerve-wracking groan was heard, and
seemingly it came from the depths of the shallow hole
in which Fritz was working. The Dutchman paused in
his labor, mopped the sweat from his face, and looked
around.</p>

<p>“Vat iss dot?” he puffed. “Vat I hear all at vonce?
Who shpoke mit me?”</p>

<p>Again Merry caused a hair-raising groan to come from
the hole. A yell of fear escaped Fritz. Dropping his
shovel, he pawed out of the hole, and got behind a rock
a dozen feet away. From this point of vantage he stared
cautiously back at the hole and, his voice shaking with
fear, inquired:</p>

<p>“Who shpoke mit me? Vat it iss, blease? I don’d
hear nodding like dot in der tream, py chiminy grickeds!”</p>

<p>“How dare you disturb my bones, looking for treasure?”
came a hollow voice from the ragged opening in
the earth. “I am the big Indian chief, Hoop-en-de-doo,
and I will haunt you and take your scalp! I shall call
all my braves from the happy hunting grounds, and we
will dance the medicine and go on the war trail; we
will——”</p>

<p>Merry was interrupted by a wild shriek that went clattering
up and down the gulch in terrifying echoes. Fritz
was not the author of it, for he seemed stricken dumb<span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span>
and rooted to the ground. It was the Mexican who
had given vent to the blood-curdling cry. Frightened
out of his wits, Silva, still emitting yell after yell, bounded
like a deer for the trail and the home camp.</p>

<p>Fritz did not see Silva, but the fierce howling, coming
nearer and nearer, must have given him the idea that
Chief Hoop-en-de-doo and all his shadowy band of warriors
were after him. Fritz awoke to feverish activity
in less than a second. He whirled, and, with remarkable
speed considering his size, scrambled for Tinaja
Wells. Silva chased him clear to the camp, where Fritz,
utterly exhausted, dropped in a heap and rolled into the
chuck tent. The Mexican vanished into some other spot
that he considered safe.</p>

<p>When the boys, roaring with laughter, finally reached
the grove, they were met by the professor and a young
fellow with blue eyes and light, curling hair. There was
a stranger in camp, it seemed, and Merry and his companions
smothered their merriment to give Borrodaile
a chance to free his mind.</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said the professor, “this hilarity is most
untimely. This young gentleman, I fear, will think you
are a lot of hoodlums. Allow me to present Mr. Ellis
Darrel, who has just arrived from Gold Hill and is
earnestly in search of information respecting the Gold
Hill Athletic Club. Darrel, Frank Merriwell, junior.”</p>

<p>Darrel was smiling. There was something about him
which, at the very first glance, appealed to Merry. The
two shook hands cordially.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_III" id="CHAPTER_III">CHAPTER III.</a><br />

<small>A FRIEND IN NEED.</small></h2>


<p>“Well, fellows,” said Ellis Darrel, after Merry had introduced
him to all the other fellows, “it looks a whole lot
as though I had dropped into the wrong pew. If I
haven’t forgotten the country hereabouts, this is sure
Tinaja Wells.”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know, Darrel,” smiled Frank.</p>

<p>“I was told in Gold Hill that a bunch of athletes belonging
to the Gold Hill Athletic Club had gone into camp
here.”</p>

<p>“Some one got mixed,” put in Clancy. “It’s an Ophir
outfit that’s taken over the Wells.”</p>

<p>“Blamed queer,” muttered Darrel, “and I’ll be hanged
if I can <i lang ="es-mx">sabe</i> the layout at all. The man in Gold Hill who
gave me the information is an officer of the club there.
It’s a cinch that he ought to know.”</p>

<p>“We’ve been here for four days,” observed Ballard,
“and we haven’t seen a thing of the Gold Hill chaps.”</p>

<p>“Live in the town, Darrel?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Used to,” was the answer. “Don’t live much of anywhere
now. Home’s wherever I hang my hat. I——”
He broke off abruptly, hesitated, then recovered himself
and went on. “I trained with the Gold Hill crowd
something like a year ago. When I drifted into town
last night and heard the gang was off in Mohave Cañon,
I kind of warmed up on the subject of athletics, bundled
up my track clothes, and moseyed in this direction.”</p>

<p>Darrel’s announcement that he was, or had been, a
member of the Gold Hill club, caused the Ophir fellows<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
to draw back into their shells somewhat, and to eye him
with distrust. Their altered demeanor was so plain that
Darrel noticed it.</p>

<p>“What’s the trouble?” he asked, looking blankly into
the faces that surrounded him. “Have I stepped on the
tail of somebody’s coat, or trampled on somebody’s
toes?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, Darrel,” laughed Frank. “Professor,”
he added, to Borrodaile, “take Darrel to our wickiup and
make him comfortable. I’ll have a talk with him as soon
as we take a dip in the pool.”</p>

<p>The professor led the puzzled Darrel away, while
Merry and his companions hurried off for a short swim
after their dusty run.</p>

<p>“Don’t like the way this Darrel is shaping up,”
grumbled Spink, splashing around in the water.</p>

<p>“Nor I,” seconded Handy. “How do we know but
that the Gold Hill crowd have steered him this way to
spy on us?”</p>

<p>“If he’s a spy, Handy,” said Frank, “then he’s a good
deal of a fool. Would a spy talk like he did?”</p>

<p>“He would not!” declared Ballard.</p>

<p>“The last time we went up against Gold Hill at football,”
remarked Bradlaugh, “we found that they had all
our signals down pat. Maybe they’re making another
play of that kind.”</p>

<p>As hurriedly as he could, Frank gave himself a rub-down
and got into his clothes.</p>

<p>“Take it from me, Brad.” said he, “Darrel isn’t that
kind of a chap. He’s straight goods, and I’ll bet on it.”</p>

<p>When he got back to the camp he found Darrel sitting
on a blanket just within the open front of the tent.
He was peering off across the cañon, with a thoughtful,
almost a sad, look on his face. He turned his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
quickly when he heard Frank, and the thoughtfulness
and the sadness vanished in a bright smile.</p>

<p>“You needn’t have rushed things on my account, Merriwell,”
said he.</p>

<p>“All I wanted was a plunge,” answered Frank, dropping
down beside him. “If you were in Gold Hill, even
as long as a year ago,” he proceeded, “you must have
known that there is a hot rivalry between the athletic
club in that town and the one in Ophir.”</p>

<p>A grim expression flashed through Darrel’s eyes.</p>

<p>“Haven’t they got over that, yet?” he asked. “Why
can’t they act like good sports instead of a lot of kids?
I had a notion that Uncle Alvah——” He bit his words
short. “I had a notion,” he finished, “that they’d see
what a rotten exhibition they were making of themselves,
and get together and play the game as it ought to be
played.”</p>

<p>“Probably they will, some time. Just now, though, if
you mention Gold Hill in an Ophir crowd, it’s like a
spark in a powder magazine. That’s why the fellows
suddenly got back of their barriers when you said that
you were a Gold Hiller, and had once trained with the
Gold Hill Athletic Club.”</p>

<p>“Well, strike me lucky!” grinned Darrel. “It’s plain
enough, now. They’re afraid I’m here to do a little dirty
work, eh? ’Pon honor, Merriwell, such a thought never
entered my noodle. As far as that goes, I doubt whether
I’m on very good terms with the Gold Hill bunch. My
half brother, Jode Lenning, is a big, high boy among the
Gold Hillers, and—and—well, Jode hasn’t much use for
me,” Darrel flushed. “Haven’t seen Jode for a year—nor
any of the other fellows, for that matter—and I was
bound for their camp to see what sort of a reception
they’d give me.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span></p>

<p>A strained silence fell over the two boys. Darrel was
touching upon personal matters, and he was doing it in a
way that made Merry uncomfortable.</p>

<p>“You see,” Darrel went on, a touch of sadness again
showing in his face, “it’s been a year since I had a home.
For more than twelve months I’ve been knocking around
the West, and—and——”</p>

<p>“You don’t have to dig down into your personal history,
Darrel,” said Frank, “in order to convince me that
you’re straight goods. I’ll take your word for it.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged, Merriwell. Not many fellows would
take the word of a perfect stranger—especially as you’re
from Ophir, and I was from Gold Hill—once.”</p>

<p>“I’m only temporarily from Ophir.” laughed Frank.
“Mr. Bradlaugh asked me to coach the Ophir eleven for
the Thanksgiving Day game with Gold Hill, and we’re
doing a certain amount of practice work every afternoon
up on the mesa back of camp.”</p>

<p>“Wow! And I came right along and jumped into the
thick of you! Well, anyhow, there’s something about
you that makes a big hit with me; and it’s been so long
since I’ve had a friend I could trust that I’d like to have
a heart-to-heart talk with you. You see, I’ve been in a
heap of trouble, and now that I’m back from Nowhere,
I’m guessing a lot as to which way the cat’s going to
jump. I’d like to get a little of that trouble out of
my system, and, if you don’t mind, I’ll begin to unload.”</p>

<p>“Go ahead,” said Frank. “I’m sure you’re the right
sort, and if I can help you any I will be glad to do it.”</p>

<p>“Shake!” exclaimed Darrel, reaching out his hand.</p>

<p>The professor was under a cottonwood with his book,
and the rest of the campers, seeming to realize that Merriwell’s
talk with Darrel was of a private nature, kept
away from them. Darrel pushed farther back into the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
tent and sat on a cot. Merriwell fallowed him and took
possession of a camp stool.</p>

<p>“I’ve been over a good bit of the country during the
past year,” said Darrel, “but in all my wanderings I’ve
never let out a whisper of what I’m going to tell you. I
said that Jode Lenning was my half brother. My father,
John Darrel, died, when I was a little shaver, and a year
later my mother followed him. Darrel was my mother’s
second husband, and David Lenning, Jode’s father, was
her first. I’m over seventeen, and Jode’s close to twenty.
My mother’s maiden name was Hawtrey, and after her
death, Jode and I went to live with her brother, Colonel
Alvah Hawtrey.”</p>

<p>“Why,” exclaimed Frank, “Colonel Hawtrey is a big
man over in Gold Hill! There’d be nothing to the Gold
Hill Athletic Club if you took the colonel out of it. At
least,” he added, “that’s what I’ve heard over in Ophir.”</p>

<p>“Well, that about hits the thing off. Uncle Alvah is
a fine old chap. He saw to it that Jode and I got our
share of physical training. I was just a little bit better
than Jode at pretty nearly everything in the athletic line,
although he could give me cards and spades in book learning,
and then leave me at the quarter post. The colonel
insisted that our mental and physical training should go
on side by side, but he’s got a sportsman’s love for
athletics, and I think he was secretly pleased because of
my good showing on the field and track. While he tried
to be impartial in his dealings with Jode and me, yet it
became pretty clear that I was his favorite nephew.
Jode didn’t like that at all; and when the colonel took us
to an athletic meet in Los Angeles, and I won a silver
cup in the two-twenty dash, Jode was soured completely.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span></p>
<p>“I reckon I hadn’t ought to talk like this, Merriwell,
and it may look to you like mighty poor policy for me to
run my half brother down, but I can’t put this business
up to you in a way that you’ll understand if I’m not
frank in telling what I know.”</p>

<p>“I guess I understand how you feel,” said Frank, “so
push ahead.”</p>

<p>“Just after winning that silver cup,” proceeded Darrel,
“I made the mistake of my life. Jode was drinking
a little and gambling a whole lot on the sly, and I was
young and foolish and thought I’d have a little of the
same fun on my own hook. I hadn’t savvy enough to
understand that by keeping away from drink and tobacco,
while Jode was taking them aboard a little on the q.  t.,
I’d been able to do a fair amount of successful work in
athletics. That’s where I had the best of Jode, you
see, but didn’t realize it. Well, I got into Jode’s crowd,
went from bad to worse, and woke up one day to find
that I’d forged the colonel’s name to a check for five
hundred dollars. Anyhow, that’s what they said I’d
done, and as I had been rather hazy from liquor at the
time the forging was done, I couldn’t deny it. I wish
I could forget the bad half hour I had with the colonel
when he found it out!”</p>

<p>Darrel shivered.</p>

<p>“Uncle Alvah’s notions of honor are pretty high,” he
continued, “and he had always prided himself on the
fact that Jode and I never smoked, or drank, or gambled.
The blow was a tough one for him. He used to be in the
army, and he’s as bluff and stern as any old martinet you
ever heard of. When he told me to clear out and never
let him see my face again, I—I cleared. That was a little
over a year ago, and I’ve been running loose all over the
Pacific slope ever since, earning a living at whatever
turned up, and was honest and square. But I’d had my
lesson; and drink, cards, or tobacco couldn’t land on me<span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span>
again. I’m physically more fit than ever I was in my
life, for the batting around I’ve had has toughened me
a heap. What’s more, I’ve had a year to think over
that forgery business, and I’ve got a notion that I didn’t—that
I <em>couldn’t</em>—have done such a thing, no matter how
hazy I was. It was up in Spokane that I was struck
with the idea that I’d better stop drifting, come back to
Gold Hill, and look into matters a little. I don’t know
what I can find, nor what I can do, but, if it’s possible,
I’m going to prove to the colonel that I didn’t put his
name to that check for five hundred. The first thing I
wanted to do was to see Jode. I was told that he had
come to Tinaja Wells, with a camping party, so I——”</p>

<p>Footsteps, approaching quickly, were heard outside the
tent, and Darrel suddenly ceased speaking. The next
moment Clancy, his freckled, homely face filled with excitement,
showed himself at the tent opening.</p>

<p>“Say, Chip,” he cried, “here’s a go! A crowd of Gold
Hillers have just reached the Wells, bag and baggage,
and claim that they’re entitled to this camping site and
are going to have it. It’s an ugly mess, and I’m looking
for all kinds of trouble. Better come out and see what
you can do.”</p>

<p>Without a moment’s delay, Merriwell jumped up from
his seat and hurried out of the tent.</p>

<small>A CLASH OF AUTHORITY.</small></h2>


<p>The sight that met Merriwell’s eyes, as he came out of
the tent and followed Clancy toward the edge of the
camp, was vastly disturbing. A train of pack animals
was being unloaded in the grove, while fifteen or twenty
saddle horses were being stripped of their gear, watered
in Mohave Creek, and staked out in the “bottoms” among
the picketed Ophir stock.</p>

<p>A swarm of youngsters overran the flat, some looking
after the horses, some helping the packer, and some beginning
the erection of tents. Merry judged that there
were at least twenty members in the party that had just
arrived.</p>

<p>“Here’s a pretty fair-sized bunch of Indians, Chip,”
said Clancy, “and they’ve got their tomahawks out.
Well,” he added grimly, “while we’re not looking for
trouble, you can bet we won’t dodge any.”</p>

<p>A worried look crossed Merriwell’s face.</p>

<p>“With the two clubs at loggerheads, like they are,”
said he, “it would be a mighty bad move, all around, for
the Gold Hillers to camp so close to us.”</p>

<p>“Bad?” echoed Clancy. “Say, Chip, how the mischief
could we do any practice work with the fellows we’re to
fight hanging around and looking on?”</p>

<p>“We couldn’t,” was the answer.</p>

<p>The Ophir contingent was drawn up in compact
formation, at the edge of the flat, watching angrily while
the Gold Hillers went calmly on with their preparations
for a permanent camp at Tinaja Wells. Bradlaugh,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
whose father was president of the O.  A.  C., was stumping
up and down and spouting wrathfully.</p>

<p>As Merriwell and Clancy walked toward the Ophir
fellows, a youth approached Bradlaugh from the direction
of the Gold Hill crowd. He was ragged out in
gray corduroy riding breeches, tan shoes and leggings,
Norfolk jacket, and a fancy brown sombrero with carved
leather band and silver ornaments jingling at the brim.
He carried a riding crop under his arm and was removing
a pair of gauntlet gloves.</p>

<p>“Look here, Lenning,” shouted Bradlaugh, plunging
straight at this rather startling figure, “what are you trying
to do here, anyhow? What business have you got
bringing a Gold Hill crowd to Tinaja Wells?”</p>

<p>Lenning turned a pair of shifty, insolent eyes upon
Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>“We’ve a right here,” said he sharply, “or we shouldn’t
be here. Pull in your horns before you make a fool of
yourself. Bradlaugh—that’s my advice to you. Where’s
this big chief, Merriwell?” A sneer there was no mistaking
came with the words “big chief.” “Trot him
out,” Lenning finished, “and it won’t take two minutes
for me to show him where you Ophirites get off.”</p>

<p>Lenning’s manner was insulting, to the last degree. A
bitter partizan spirit was already flaming in the Ophir
ranks, aroused by the plain determination of the Gold
Hillers to take possession of the camping ground. Brad’s
temper had been strained to the breaking point even before
the appearance of Lenning, and now, under the
weight of Lenning’s insolence, it gave way utterly.</p>

<p>“You pup!” shouted Brad, leaping at Lenning with
clenched fists.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span> “It’s a cinch you’ve got some dirty trick
up your sleeve or you wouldn’t blow in here in this
high-and-mighty fashion. I’ve a notion to punch your
head on general principles.”</p>

<p>Lenning jumped back and lifted the riding crop.</p>

<p>“Try it on,” he snarled, “and I’ll rip off some of your
hide!”</p>

<p>A number of Gold Hillers, scenting trouble, hastened
to run out of the grove and line up back of their champion.
The Ophir fellows pressed forward to back up
Bradlaugh. Fritz Gesundheit, who loved excitement in
any form, showed himself for the first time since being
chased up the cañon by the spook of old Chief Hoop-en-de-doo.
Rolling out of the chuck tent, he waddled
toward Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>“Gif him fits mit himselluf, Prad!” he called. “I bet
you someding for nodding he iss some pad eggs.”</p>

<p>The Gold Hill packer was a Mexican, and already he
and Silva had come to blows. They could be heard
screeching and floundering around in the underbrush. It
was a moment rife with many disagreeable possibilities,
and only quick and judicious action on Merriwell’s part
could prevent a general row.</p>

<p>“Clan,” said he, “you and Ballard go over and separate
those greasers before they get to knifing each
other. I’ll take care of this end of the ruction. Do your
best to smooth things out, or we’ll all be in hot water.”</p>

<p>While Clancy grabbed Ballard and hustled away with
him, Merriwell jumped in between Brad and Lenning.</p>

<p>“Cut it out, Brad!” said he sharply, giving the fiery
youngster a push backward. “All you fellows,” he
added, to the Ophir crowd, “are carrying too much sail.
Double reef your tempers and we’ll weather this squall
without much trouble.” He whirled on Lenning. “I’m
Merriwell,” said he.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span> “I believe I heard you asking for
me as I came up.”</p>

<p>“That’s what you heard,” was the answer. “I’m Jode
Lenning, and Colonel Hawtrey, of Gold Hill, is my uncle.
The colonel——”</p>

<p>“What has this to do with Colonel Hawtrey?” interrupted
Merry.</p>

<p>Remembering what Darrel had just been telling him,
Frank was taking Lenning’s measure with a good deal of
interest. His comparison of the two half brothers gave
Darrel no end the best of it.</p>

<p>“My uncle,” drawled Lenning, running his eyes over
Merry in an impudent up-and-down stare, “has a lot to
do with our athletic club but he’s not mixed up in this
camping expedition. He has been out of town for a
week, but I expect him back to-day, and——”</p>

<p>“Let us hope that he gets back safely,” said Merry,
with just a touch of sarcasm in his voice. “Are you intending
to camp here, Lenning?”</p>

<p>“Not intending only, but we’re going to.”</p>

<p>“Allow me to suggest that we have already occupied
the flat, and that I don’t think the grove is big enough
for an outfit of Gold Hillers and Ophirites. You ought
to know that as well as I do. Move on and find some
other place.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got a rind!” grunted Lenning. “We’re out
here for fun and work, and we need the mesa for an
athletic field. I’ve leased the ground, and I want you
fellows to pack up and clear out at once.”</p>

<p>This was staggering. Merriwell supposed that Brad’s
father had leased the ground. In that section of the
country there were very few places so adapted to the
needs of the Ophir fellows as was the grove and mesa
at Tinaja Wells.</p>

<p>“We’ve leased the ground ourselves!” shouted Brad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
“and we’ve got it down in black and white.”</p>

<p>“He’s shy a few,” said Lenning, and drew a paper
from the pocket of his coat and showed it to Merriwell.</p>

<p>It was a written memorandum of agreement. In consideration
of twenty dollars, in hand paid, one Lige
Struthers had given the Gold Hill Athletic Club exclusive
camping privileges at Tinaja Wells.</p>

<p>“This appears to be all right, Brad,” said Merriwell,
bewildered.</p>

<p>“Who leased the ground to Lenning?” demanded Brad.</p>

<p>“A man named Struthers; Lige Struthers.”</p>

<p>Brad laughed ironically.</p>

<p>“Struthers doesn’t own the ground,” said he. “Newt
Packard is the owner, and he’s the one that gave us our
lease. Hold your bronks a minute.”</p>

<p>Brad turned and hurried off to one of the tents. When
he came back, he brought a paper showing that Bradlaugh,
senior, had secured the site exclusively for the
Ophir club.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Merriwell. “How could two
different men execute leases on the same plot of ground?
There’s a hen on, somewhere.”</p>

<p>“It’s Packard’s ground,” declared Brad. “Right at this
minute Struthers is fighting Packard for it in the courts,
but Struther’s claim is a joke—he hasn’t a legal leg to
stand on. Everybody says so. This is a scheme of
Lenning’s, Chip, to drive us from Tinaja Wells.”</p>

<p>“Scheme or not,” cried Lenning, “we’ve got our rights
and we’re going to stand up to them!”</p>

<p>“Even if Struthers has a just claim on the place, Lenning,”
said Merry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span> “your right here isn’t any better than
ours. If Struthers happens to win the lawsuit, then
we have to get out, for our leave isn’t any good; but if
Packard wins, then that paper of yours isn’t worth a
whoop, and Tinaja Wells is ours.”</p>

<p>“You’ll make tracks from here,” stormed Lenning, “or
we’ll drive you out! We’ve got a big enough crowd
to do it.”</p>

<p>Merry’s dark eyes flashed dangerously.</p>

<p>“You’ll not drive us out,” said he calmly, “as long as
we have a right here. And we’ll not be able to force you
to leave so long as the lawsuit is hanging fire.”</p>

<p>“Bossession iss nine points oof der law,” clamored
Fritz truculently, “und ve vas here fairst, py shinks. I
haf reasons for vich I don’d vand to ged oudt, und I
don’d vant more fellers as is necessary aroundt.”</p>

<p>Nobody paid much attention to Fritz just then. The
Ophirites were keeping their eyes on Merriwell, smothering
their hostility as best they could and letting him cut
the pattern they were to follow.</p>

<p>Clancy and Ballard, a little while before, had returned
from the chaparral with Silva. The Mexican was fairly
boiling with rage, but the lads were managing to hold
him in check.</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Carramba!</i>” hissed Silva. “Dat odder Mexicano he
move my burro, to give his burro best place. I lick
him for dat, bymby!”</p>

<p>Merry was filled with forebodings as to what might
happen if both parties went into camp at the Wells; and
yet, considering the peculiar condition of affairs, there
seemed no possible way to avoid a division of the camping
privileges. Both sides held a lease of the ground;
and, not until the lawsuit between Struthers and Packard
was settled, would it be known which side was entitled
to the exclusive use of Tinaja Wells.</p>

<p>“I’ll give you fellows half an hour to begin packing.”
blustered Lenning. “If you don’t show symptoms of
leaving by that time, there’ll be a fight!”</p>

<p>“I think not,” said Frank, still holding his temper in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
check. “For the present, Lenning, we’ll both camp at
the Wells, and both have the use of water and forage.
You and your crowd will keep away from us, however,
and we’ll do our best to keep away from you. There’s
no sense in having a mix-up.”</p>

<p>“Half an hour,” threatened Lenning. “I’m banking
on Struthers. This is his water and his ground, and
he’s the only one that has a right to give a lease. We’ve
got a bigger crowd than you have, and it won’t bother
us much to run you out.”</p>

<p>Here was a complication of the tangle which Merriwell
did not relish a little bit. Nevertheless, he knew
he was within his rights and he had no intention of backing
down and letting Lenning have his way.</p>

<p>Lenning had spun around on his heel with the intention
of returning to the spot where his own camp was
being put in shape, when Ellis Darrel hurried forward.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a rush, Jode,” called Darrel. “I want a
word with you.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_V" id="CHAPTER_V">CHAPTER V.</a><br />

<small>A CHALLENGE.</small></h2>


<p>The sound of Darrel’s voice caused Lenning to whirl
as though a rattlesnake had suddenly buzzed its warning
behind him. The look on the fellow’s scowling face was
one of stunned astonishment. For a brief space, the
two half brothers stared at each other; then Lenning,
seeming to get a grip on himself, demanded contemptuously:</p>

<p>“Who the devil are you?”</p>

<p>Darrel peered at him in amazement.</p>

<p>“Well, strike me lucky!” he muttered. “You can’t
run in a bluff like that, Jode. You know me, all right.
I’ve changed a heap in a year, I know, but not in the
way that would keep you from recognizing me.”</p>

<p>A gasp of astonishment escaped Brad’s lips. His surprise
was echoed by at least half a dozen others among
the Ophir crowd, and by practically all the Gold Hillers.</p>

<p>It was to be presumed that a former member of the
Gold Hill club could not have dropped entirely out of
remembrance during the absence of a year; and it was
but natural that some of the Ophir fellows should have
been acquainted with Darrel. That the Ophir lads had
not recalled Darrel before, seemed strange to Merriwell.
And he was even more astonished now, when
recognition seemed almost general, at the queer twist
which had entered into the situation.</p>

<p>While plainly discovering in Darrel something that was
familiar to them, a general acceptance of the “boy from
Nowhere” as the person he purported to be, was hanging<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
fire. Darrel himself seemed as much perplexed about
this as Merriwell was.</p>

<p>“I don’t recognize you,” said Lenning, “and that’s all
there is to it.”</p>

<p>“Well, if you don’t,” answered Darrel, “some of the
other fellows from Gold Hill have better memories.
How about it, boys,” he asked, appealing directly to the
crowd behind Lenning.</p>

<p>“You look a lot like Ellis Darrel,” said one of the
Gold Hillers.</p>

<p>“He’s a dead ringer for El,” averred another.</p>

<p>“But he can’t be my half brother!” cried Lenning.
“He’s an imposter, by thunder! Why are the Ophir
fellows springing him on us? What’s your scheme,
Merriwell?” he demanded, turning on Frank.</p>

<p>“No scheme about it,” Frank answered. “This chap
is Ellis Darrel. If he looks like Darrel, and says he’s
Darrel, what in thunder’s the reason you don’t accept
him as Darrel?”</p>

<p>“Because Ellis Darrel is dead,” said one of the Gold
Hillers who had spoken before.</p>

<p>“That’s news to me,” returned Darrel whimsically.</p>

<p>“It’s a fact; whether it’s news to you or not,” said
Lenning.</p>

<p>“When did I die?” inquired Darrel, with a short laugh.</p>

<p>“Three or four months ago,” went on Lenning. “The
papers were full of it. You can’t run in any rhinecaboo
on us, just because you happen to look like my half
brother.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span></p>
<p>“No rhinecaboo about it, Jode. If the papers reported
my demise, then the report was slightly exaggerated.
I never felt better in my life, nor more like
living and making life worth while. How was I taken
off, eh?”</p>

<p>“Darrel was killed in a railroad wreck in Colorado.
He was identified by something in his coat pockets.
Uncle Alvah sent on enough to bury him, and some of
the authorities had him decently planted. I don’t know
what your real name is, but I’ll gamble a thousand
against a chink wash ticket that this railroad accident
is no news to you. You’ve come on here to bluff the
thing through, make the colonel believe you’re his wandering
nephew, and then put you in his will along with
me. But the scheme won’t work. When the real Darrel
forged that check, he killed all his hopes of ever
connecting with any of Uncle Al’s money. Didn’t know
about that forged check, eh? Well, you’d better skip
if you don’t want to get yourself in trouble.”</p>

<p>With a contemptuous fling of his shoulders, Lenning
whirled again as though he would leave. Darrel, his face
convulsed with anger, leaped at him and jerked him
around.</p>

<p>“You don’t get away from me like this, Jode,” he
cried. “There’s been a big mistake, but I think I can
understand how it happened. While I was working at
a mine in Cripple Creek some one stole my coat. I think
it was a hobo. If there was a railroad smash-up, then
the hobo was killed and supposed to be me from something
found in the stolen coat. I never heard of that
wreck, or that I was supposed to have been a victim of
it. I don’t know whether I should have set the matter
right, even if I had heard of it; but I can correct the
mistake now, and you can bet your bottom dollar I’m
going to!”</p>

<p>Lenning, held against his will, shook Darrel’s hand
roughly from his arm.</p>

<p>“You’ve got your scheme all framed up, I reckon,”
said Lenning angrily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span> “but it won’t work. My half
brother’s dead, and you can’t palm yourself off as Ellis
Darrel. You’ll find yourself behind the bars if you try
it. The colonel won’t stand for any monkey business
of that sort.”</p>

<p>“I didn’t come back to get any of the colonel’s money,”
went on Darrel. “What I came back for was to prove
that I’m not a forger. First, I’ll offer evidence that I’m
Ellis Darrel, and then I’ll make the other part of it plain.”</p>

<p>“How’ll you prove that you’re my half brother?” asked
Lenning mockingly.</p>

<p>“Who was the best sprinter in the Gold Hill Athletic
Club?” returned Darrel. “Who won the two-twenty
dash at Los Angeles?”</p>

<p>“Darrel,” answered one of the Gold Hillers.</p>

<p>“Who was the next best sprinter in the club?”</p>

<p>“Jode Lenning.”</p>

<p>“Now you’re shouting,” went on Darrel. “If I run
against Lenning, and beat him, I’ll bet a pack of pesos
that every member of the Gold Hill club will agree that
I’m the fellow I say I am. If I look like Darrel, and
am trying to run in a bluff on you because of it, is it at
all likely that I could run like Darrel? You’ll see, if
you give me the chance to show it, that I have the same
form and the same speed.”</p>

<p>“You’re a rank counterfeit,” scoffed Lenning, “and I’ll
not have a thing to do with you.”</p>

<p>But the rest of the Gold Hillers, as Frank could see,
were not disposed to have the matter brushed lightly aside
in that way. Perhaps there were some among them who
had known and liked Darrel, and felt that this newcomer
should have every chance to make good his pretensions.</p>

<p>Merriwell, facing a difficult situation because of the
dispute regarding the camping site, saw a chance to shift<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
the attention of the rival clubs to a foot race, and thus,
for the time, patch up their other differences. Not only
that, but the “boy from Nowhere,” while helping out the
general situation, would be making a logical attempt to
prove his identity.</p>

<p>Personally, Merriwell did not doubt Ellis Darrel in
the least; but he was beginning to have ugly misgivings
regarding Jode Lenning.</p>

<p>“Is that a challenge, Darrel?” Frank asked.</p>

<p>Darrel nodded. “Jode wants to believe that I have
kicked the bucket,” said he, “and he’s afraid to run
against me. He knows, if he does, that I’ll beat him,
and that the Gold Hill fellows will wipe out that foolish
railroad accident and take me at my word.”</p>

<p>“You’re a fake,” scowled Lenning, “and I tell you I’ll
not run against you. What I’m going to do, though, is
to send to Gold Hill after the sheriff and have you locked
up. The colonel will deal with you, my festive buck!”</p>

<p>Again Lenning started to leave the scene. This time,
however, he was halted by one of his own crowd.</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a hurry, Jode,” said the fellow who had
stepped in front of him. “I reckon this here’s a case
that’s not to be passed up in any offhand way like you’re
doin’. Hey, fellers?”</p>

<p>There was a chorus of approval of the Gold Hill chap’s
words from the rest of his companions.</p>

<p>“You can prove he’s a fake, Jode!” said one.</p>

<p>“Give him a chance, anyhow!” cried another.</p>

<p>“It’s no more than a fair shake to run against him,”
chimed in a third.</p>

<p>All the others had more or less to say in favor of Lenning’s
accepting the challenge. Lenning, because of this,
was placed in a most uncomfortable position. If he
still refused to run, it would appear as though he was<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
anxious not to do the fair thing; on the other hand, if
the race was run, and Darrel came out ahead, this might
convince the Gold Hillers that he was all he claimed
to be.</p>

<p>Lenning stood for a moment, thinking the matter over;
then, suddenly, his face cleared.</p>

<p>“All right, Bleeker,” said he to the fellow who had
stepped in front of him. “I’m not afraid to run against
the fellow. Even if he wins, and if he proves that he’s
really Ellis Darrel, he’ll be sorry for it. My half brother
disgraced himself, and was ordered by the colonel to
clear out. If this chap wasn’t a fool, he’d prefer to
drop the matter right here and make himself scarce,
rather than to try to prove that he’s Darrel, the forger.”</p>

<p>“Then you accept the challenge, do you, Lenning?”
inquired Merriwell.</p>

<p>“You heard me,” was the snarling response.</p>

<p>“What’s the distance, and when do you want to pull
off the race?”</p>

<p>“Hundred yards; and we’ll run ’em off to-morrow
afternoon. Now, if you’re all satisfied, I’ll go back and
boss the operation of getting our camp in shape.”</p>

<p>The acceptance of that challenge put an altogether
different complexion upon the situation, so far as it concerned
differences regarding the camping ground. A
spirit of sportsmanship had been aroused, and the animosity
that had long existed between the rival clubs
had, for the time, been pushed into the background.
Merriwell was greatly pleased over the outcome.</p>

<p>“This hundred-yard dash is a good thing, all around,”
said he to Darrel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span> “Until to-morrow afternoon, anyhow,
we’re going to have peace at Tinaja Wells. Already Lenning’s
threat to run us off the flat if we weren’t packing
up in half an hour has been forgotten. I’m hoping that
something will happen, soon after the race, to show
whether Struthers or Packard owns this camping site.
Have you kept in training during the past year, Darrel?”</p>

<p>“As well as I could,” was the answer. “I’d like to
practice starts a little, this afternoon. Will you help
me?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” answered Merriwell heartily. “We’ll go up
on the mesa right away, and begin. Bring the pistol,
Brad. Get into your speed togs, Darrel. I’ll be waiting
here for you.”</p>

<p>Brad went after the starter’s pistol and Darrel, securing
his roll of clothes from the place where he had left
it, disappeared inside of Merriwell’s tent.</p>

<p>While waiting, Merriwell saw two horsemen coming
down the cañon and heading toward Tinaja Wells. One
was a tall, soldierly appearing man with a white mustache,
and the other was a roughly dressed, businesslike-appearing
fellow, with a hatchet face.</p>

<p>A shout went up from Bleeker, of Gold Hill, who was
the first of his party to catch sight of the approaching
riders.</p>

<p>“Whoop!” he shouted, “here comes the colonel! Call
Jode, somebody.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_VI" id="CHAPTER_VI">CHAPTER VI.</a><br />

<small>PUZZLING DEVELOPMENTS.</small></h2>


<p>A thrill ran through Merriwell’s nerves. Colonel
Hawtrey had come to Tinaja Wells and had ridden his
horse hard in making the trip. Why was he there, and
why was he in a hurry?</p>

<p>The colonel’s presence in camp would not have taken
on such a momentous aspect had Frank not instantly
recognized the colonel’s companion. This man’s name
was Hawkins. He was a good friend of Frank’s; but,
as it also happened, he was a deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>Hawtrey had come to the camp hurriedly, and had
brought with him an officer of the law. Merriwell’s mind
circled vainly about these two facts. His heart sank as
he thought the developments might portend some fresh
disaster for Darrel.</p>

<p>At the edge of the grove the colonel and the deputy
dismounted. Jode Lenning appeared, seemingly nervous
and ill at ease, and stumbled forward to grasp his uncle’s
hand. The two, talking earnestly together, disappeared
in the direction of one of the Gold Hill tents.</p>

<p>Hawkins, catching sight of Merriwell, smiled and
greeted him with a friendly wave of the hand; then, leading
the two horses, he went down over the edge of the
flat and into the cañon.</p>

<p>Frank would have liked to follow him, and to learn, if
possible, the reason why he and the colonel had come to
Tinaja Wells. Just at that moment, however, Darrel
appeared in his track clothes and Brad came up with
the starter’s pistol.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span></p>

<p>Fritz was already busy with supper preparations, and
Darrel would have no more than an hour for practice,
at the outside. Merry, leaving the puzzling developments
to take care of themselves, joined Darrel and
Brad, and the three made their way up a low slope beyond
the flat to the mesa.</p>

<p>This little plateau was at least two acres in extent,
as flat as a floor, clear of obstructions in the form of
bowlders and desert plants, and with a surface almost
as hard and springy as a cinder path. It was a natural
athletic field, and its proximity to Tinaja Wells was what
made the place so desirable as a camping ground for a
club that intended to give sports a large share of its
outing.</p>

<p>Darrel, in his track clothes, was a splendid specimen
of physical development. To Merriwell’s practiced eye,
however, he seemed built for a sprinter, and perhaps
could have done well as a long-distance man, but could
hardly distinguish himself as an all-round athlete.</p>

<p>“The Gold Hill camp has a visitor, Darrel,” said
Frank. “Did you see him arrive?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the answer, “I was busy getting into my
togs. Who is it?”</p>

<p>“Coloney Hawtrey.”</p>

<p>A touch of white ran through Darrel’s face. He
halted abruptly and half turned as though to retrace his
way to the camp; then, apparently changing his mind, he
faced about and went on into the mesa.</p>

<p>“The colonel thinks I’ve crossed the divide,” said he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
“and he wouldn’t have any use for me if he was convinced
that I’m alive and kicking. Time enough to pay
my respects to him after I dig up proof that I didn’t
forge his name to that check. Did he come alone, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“Hawkins, a deputy sheriff, came with him.”</p>

<p>“Strike me lucky! Say, I’ll bet a bunch of dinero that
my precious little half brother has put up some sort of
a dodge on me.” He halted once more, and, with deep
earnestness in voice and manner, turned to Merriwell
and added: “I want you to promise that you won’t go
back on me, no matter what happens.”</p>

<p>“I believe you’re straight,” said Merriwell promptly,
“and you can bank on me to stand by you.”</p>

<p>“And lend a hand, if I need it?”</p>

<p>“Sure.”</p>

<p>“Count me in on that, too, Darrel,” put in Brad.</p>

<p>“You fellows are pretty good to a stranger,” said
Darrel, his voice husky with feeling. “I won’t forget it,
either. Now, changing the subject a little and coming
down to this race of mine against Jode, I might be an
impostor, and, at the same time, happen to have the
speed to beat him over that hundred yards; but any one
that ever saw Ellis Darrel run knows that he has a form
of his own—a few individualities that crop out on the
track and could not be copied. That is going to do more
than just winning the race to put me in right with the
Gold Hill fellows. See what I mean, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>Frank nodded understandingly.</p>

<p>“Jode has a few peculiarities himself,” Darrel went on,
“and one of them is beating the pistol.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty crooked,” said Frank. “A fellow that
makes a practice of it is bound to be found out, sooner
or later, and made to take his medicine.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span></p>
<p>“Starters, as you know, don’t all wait the same length
of time between the order to get set and the ‘crack’ that
starts them over the course; but, almost invariably, each
starter has his own habit, and clings to it. Some starters
may wait two seconds, and some four, and if a sprinter
knows his man, he can get off with the pistol, and not
after he hears it. If a sprinter is clever at it, it’s mighty
hard to detect him; and if he is detected occasionally
he can plead nervousness, and get off without much
trouble. Now, Jode’s pretty slick at the game; and if
Beman, one of the boys in the Gold Hill crowd, fires the
pistol, Jode will know exactly what to do.”</p>

<p>“We’ll see to it that Beman doesn’t act as starter,”
declared Brad.</p>

<p>“You get me wrong, Bradlaugh,” returned Darrel.
“If Jode makes the request, I want you to let Beman
act. Then watch Jode, both of you. If he beats the
pistol, then you’ll understand that I know what I’m
talking about. It will be a little proof that I’m playing
square; and, whatever happens, I don’t want you to
doubt me.”</p>

<p>“If a man gains half a second at the start, Darrel,”
protested Frank, “you ought to know what it means in
a hundred-yard dash. It’s the same as leading you at
the start by anywhere from ten to twenty feet. A fairly
good runner will cover twenty-five feet of ground in a
second.”</p>

<p>Darrel smiled cheerfully.</p>

<p>“Let Jode have his lead,” said he; “unless he has
picked up wonderfully in the last year I won’t be taking
his dust for many yards.”</p>

<p>With his heel, Darrel traced a line on the ground.</p>

<p>“Here’s the starting point, Merriwell,” he observed.
“If you’re ready, I am.”</p>

<p>Frank took the pistol from Brad and placed himself
behind Darrel.</p>

<p>“On your mark!” he called out, then watched critically
to see Darrel place himself.</p>

<p>If the “boy from Nowhere” had any eccentricities in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
his sprinting, none showed in the way he dropped to the
line and began gouging into the earth with the toe of
his left foot.</p>

<p>“Set!” called Frank.</p>

<p>The muscles began to twist under the white skin of
Darrel’s legs and arms like so many coiled springs. Up
came the right knee while the toe of the right foot
ground out its own little pocket in the soil. The weight
of Darrel’s body was thrown on his fingers and over the
starting line.</p>

<p>Frank, admiring the sprinter’s ease, which spoke volumes
for the amount of hard practice he had undergone,
purposely waited an inordinate length of time before
snapping the pistol. An alert mind is as necessary in a
good sprinter as a pair of speedy legs; and there must
be good nerves, to hold the clamoring muscles in leash
until exactly the right moment to let them go.</p>

<p>Bang! went the signal, and on the instant Darrel flung
from the line as though shot from a cannon. He ran for
perhaps twenty yards before he halted, and came trotting
back.</p>

<p>“Did you see how I do my running?” he asked.</p>

<p>“You slide,” answered Frank; “there’s not much waste
motion in lifting your feet.”</p>

<p>“And the way you handle your arms,” said Brad.
“You’re a daisy, old top, believe me!”</p>

<p>“Not many sprinters go the way I go, and I’ve a hunch
that the Gold Hill fellows will recognize Ellis Darrel
from that alone. A lot of that crowd have seen me run
dozens of times.”</p>

<p>“I can’t understand what in thunder’s biting those fellows,
anyway,” grunted Merriwell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span> “Suppose there was
a railroad accident, and they’ve been under the impression
for months that you got your gruel in the smash-up;
why don’t they believe you, when you explain about the
coat, and tell them who you are?”</p>

<p>“They’re a lot of boneheads!” declared Brad; “or
else,” he qualified, “they’re taking their cue from Lenning.”</p>

<p>“That’s the size of it,” said Darrel. “The colonel’s a
pretty big man, over in Gold Hill, and some of that crowd
would lick Jode’s shoes if he told ’em to. But,” and
Darrel grinned, “you seemed rather anxious to have the
race come off, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“It was the best thing that could happen, right at that
stage of our dispute with the Gold Hillers,” Merriwell
answered. “We needed something to ease up the tension,
and turn our thoughts to something else beside
the camping site. This race dropped in pretty pat. But
we’ve got to cut out this chin-chin and practice a few
more starts. On your mark!”</p>

<p>For perhaps a dozen times Merriwell got Darrel away
from the line. The last two or three times constituted
about as finished a performance as Merriwell had ever
seen.</p>

<p>“You’re all the mustard, Darrel,” said Frank. “I
don’t think there’s any chance for improvement. I’ve
started you from ‘set’ all the way from an eye wink to
ten seconds, and you haven’t made a bobble. You’re in
the way of becoming a crack man at this game.”</p>

<p>Darrel’s fine face flushed with pleasure.</p>

<p>“Coming from you, old chap,” said he, “that’s a fine
compliment. You’re giving me a helping hand, and I’m
hungry to show you that I deserve it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret about that. My dad is a master hand at
reading character, and he has passed the knack on to me.
One look at you was enough. But,” he added suddenly,
tossing the pistol to Brad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span> “Carrots will be yelling his
Dutch head off if we don’t hustle to the chuck tent.
Have you any sort of an idea,” he asked, as they started
together toward the camp, “why the colonel and the
deputy sheriff should ride out here?”</p>

<p>“No,” and Darrel shook his head in a puzzled way,
“but you’re liable to find out. Here’s the deputy sheriff,
and he seems to have his eyes on you.”</p>

<p>Hawkins had strolled up over the edge of the mesa
and was walking toward the three boys. When he was
close to them, he nodded in a friendly way.</p>

<p>“I’d like to powwow with you, Merriwell,” said he,
“for a couple of minutes, more or less. Suppose you let
your friends go on, while we trail them in, and palaver
on the way?”</p>

<p>Merriwell, with a feeling that something of importance
was coming, dropped behind Brad and Darrel and fell
into step with the deputy sheriff.</p>

<small>THE WILES OF A SCHEMER.</small></h2>


<p>Jode Lenning was alone in the tent, which had been
erected for his use, when Mingo, a Mexican distance
runner, who belonged to the G.  H.  A.  C., thrust his head
through the flap and announced that Colonel Hawtrey
had arrived in camp.</p>

<p>Lenning, at the moment, had his back to the opening
and was wrapping a long, flat package in his handkerchief.</p>

<p>“What?” he gasped, throwing a startled look over his
shoulder at Mingo.</p>

<p>The other repeated his announcement.</p>

<p>“The devil!” gulped Lenning, in a flurry. “He’s found
out what happened at the house, and put for here on
the jump. Now for merry blazes, and a little slick work
by yours truly.”</p>

<p>His hand shook a little as he crowded the handkerchief-wrapped
package into the breast of his Norfolk jacket;
then, getting up, he hurried out of the tent and ran to
meet the tall man with the gray mustache.</p>

<p>“Ah, my boy!” exclaimed Colonel Hawtrey, making
no effort to conceal the pleasure the meeting gave him.
“You’re looking fit, I must say, so there’s not much use
asking how you feel.”</p>

<p>“Fine as silk, uncle,” said Lenning, clasping the colonel’s
hand. “How did you find everything at the mines?”</p>

<p>“The mines are all right,” was the answer,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_48">48</span> “but it was
something I discovered after I got home this morning that
has rather shaken me. Take me to a place where we
can be by ourselves and talk.”</p>

<p>“My tent will fill the bill.” They walked together in
the direction of Lenning’s headquarters. “Was that
Hawkins I saw leading away the horses?” Lenning
asked.</p>

<p>“Yes, that was Hawkins.” That there was a load of
some sort on the colonel’s mind was evidenced by his tone
and manner. “It’s possible,” he added, “that I am going
to need Hawkins in—er—an official capacity.”</p>

<p>“This sounds pretty warlike!” exclaimed Lenning.</p>

<p>“I suppose so,” and the old soldier stiffened a little. “I
have made some discoveries, Jode, which will astonish
you. They nearly carried me off my feet. By the way,
what started you on this camping trip?”</p>

<p>“I thought it would be a good thing for our eleven,”
Lenning explained. “This Merriwell chap took the Ophir
team out into the hills, and I reckoned we’d follow suit.
And, say! We bumped into the Ophir outfit right here
at Tinaja Wells. How’s that for a coincidence?”</p>

<p>“Queer, to say the least,” answered the colonel. “I
hope all you fellows will remember that you are true
sportsmen, which is only another term for gentlemen, and
avoid any unpleasantness.”</p>

<p>“You can depend upon us to prove a credit to you,
colonel!” said Lenning, with a fine show of admiration
for the erect, soldierly old fellow beside him. “I have
a lease from Struthers, and Merriwell has one from
Packard. Now,” and Lenning laughed, “which of us has
the right of it?”</p>

<p>“That’s hard to tell, my boy, until the lawsuit is decided.
What sort of a character is young Merriwell?
Anything like his father?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know much about his father, sir; but young
Merriwell seems to be trying to make himself the whole
thing. Of course,” Lenning added,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_49">49</span> “I tried to smooth
matters over, and it looks as though I had succeeded.
As you see, we’re both camped on the same ground.”</p>

<p>“I’ll have a talk with Merriwell myself, and see what
I can do with him. All that, however, must wait on
the important business that brings me here. I have never
had anything make such an impression on me. Is this
your tent, Jode?”</p>

<p>“Yes, uncle. Walk inside and make yourself comfortable.”</p>

<p>When Colonel Hawtrey had seated himself comfortably
on a camp stool, and Lenning had dropped down
facing him on a pile of blankets, the colonel lighted a
cigar—possibly to soothe or cover his nervousness—and
began.</p>

<p>“You remember, Jode,” said he, “that I drew a thousand
dollars from the bank on the forenoon of the day
I left town, expecting to pay it out to Judson for an
interest in that promising claim of his.”</p>

<p>Lenning nodded.</p>

<p>“You drew the money,” said he, “and Judson didn’t
show up; then you were called from town in a hurry, and
locked up the money in your safe. I remember all that
very distinctly.”</p>

<p>“You knew the combination, and were to give Judson
the money if he called for it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, sir; but he didn’t call.”</p>

<p>“I know that. I had scarcely reached town when I
saw him, and he said he’d be around this afternoon to get
the thousand. Then I went home—and found that I had
been robbed!”</p>

<p>“Robbed!” gasped Lenning, starting up.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_50">50</span></p>
<p>“Yes, my boy, robbed! Of course, a thousand dollars
isn’t very much to me, but it’s losing the money in
such a way as that that gets under my skin. The safe in
my study was open, the window had been unlocked, and
the thousand was gone!”</p>

<p>“Had the safe been blown open?”</p>

<p>“No. Some one had worked the combination and——”</p>

<p>“Uncle!” exclaimed Lenning, in consternation. “You
and I are the only ones who know the combination.
You were away from home, and I—I——”</p>

<p>The colonel leaned forward and dropped an affectionate
hand on his nephew’s shoulder.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” said he brusquely. “You know I trust you
as I would myself. There is some one else who knows
the combination, and who at one time had as free access
to that safe as you or I. I refer to—to your half brother,
Darrel.”</p>

<p>“But Ellis perished in that train wreck!”</p>

<p>“Supposed to, but I have always had a feeling
that there might be some mistake. That graceless young
scamp wasn’t born to shuffle off in any such way as
that. What I should have done, I suppose, was to have
the combination changed. But I did not. This is the
result.”</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t be in too much of a hurry to judge Ellis,
Uncle Al,” pleaded Lenning. “You’re only working on
a theory, you know, and——”</p>

<p>There was sorrow in the fine old face of the colonel,
but over all was the sternness of an iron will.</p>

<p>“I have evidence,” he interrupted; “much as it grieves
me to tell it, Jode, yet I have evidence which cannot be
denied. It is like you, boy, to plead for the rascal who
has disgraced our blood; but, as for me, I shall not be
victimized a second time without making him pay the
penalty. I—— You are pale!” exclaimed the colonel,
leaning forward to stare into his nephew’s face;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_51">51</span> “and
you are trembling, too! What ails you, Jode? Brace up;
don’t take this too much to heart.”</p>

<p>“I have something to tell you, uncle,” answered Lenning;
“but, first, let me hear your evidence.”</p>

<p>The colonel took a knife from his pocket and handed
it to Lenning.</p>

<p>“You recognize that, don’t you?” he asked harshly.</p>

<p>“Why,” murmured Lenning, “it’s the knife you gave
Ellis years ago.”</p>

<p>“It is,” was the grim rejoinder, “and I found it under
the unlocked window in my study.”</p>

<p>Lenning seemed stunned and incapable of words.</p>

<p>“But that isn’t all,” preceded the colonel. “I hunted
up Hawkins, who happened to be in town, and together
we learned that a fellow answering Darrel’s description
had been in Gold Hill the night before I got home. He
had called on Haff, our club secretary, and asked for me,
and about you. Haff told him that you were camping,
with some of our lads, at Tinaja Wells. Supposing that
Darrel had come here, Hawkins and I secured a couple
of mounts and made a quick trip down the cañon. Have
you seen anything of Darrel?”</p>

<p>“Then it’s true, it’s true!” Lenning was muttering, as
though to himself.</p>

<p>“What is true?” demanded his uncle. “Don’t try to
shield the fellow, Jode. Your first duty is to me, not to
him.”</p>

<p>“There is a fellow here—Merriwell seems to be
looking after him—who says he is Ellis Darrel.” Lenning
spoke with apparent reluctance. “I believed him to
be an imposter. How could I think anything else after
the report we had of that Colorado wreck? The fellow
seemed bent on proving that he was really my half<span class="pagenum" id="Page_52">52</span>
brother, and challenged me to run a race with him. You
see——”</p>

<p>“What folly!” cut in the colonel.</p>

<p>“I’m pretty fast in a sprint, uncle, but El was a shade
faster. And you know he had a queer way about him
when he was running. I think he is counting on that
race to make his identity known to me and the rest of
the Gold Hill fellows.”</p>

<p>“We don’t need any proof of his identity, Jode! We
can take his word, and then confront him with this
damning evidence of his rascality!”</p>

<p>Lenning put out his hand and rested it on his uncle’s
arm.</p>

<p>“Colonel,” said he, his voice shaking, “let us have this
race to-morrow afternoon. Don’t interfere. There’s a
chance that, after all, the fellow is not Darrel.”</p>

<p>“There’s not a shadow of a doubt, not a shadow!”</p>

<p>“But you needn’t hurry about arresting him, need you?
Let’s find out how far Merriwell will go in trying to
shield him. Wait until after the race; and then—well,”
and Lenning drew a long, regretful sigh, “do what you
think you have to—what you think you must.”</p>

<p>“If Darrel knows I am here with Hawkins he may suspect
something, and clear out,” demurred the colonel.
“It isn’t well, my boy, to dally too much with an affair of
this kind.”</p>

<p>“Have Hawkins watch him,” suggested Lenning.</p>

<p>“True,” said the colonel, “I could probably do that.
It’s impossible, though, that Young Merriwell is mixed
up, in any way, with Darrel’s wrongdoing. He has been
deceived in the fellow. I know of the elder Merriwell,
and a straighter man or a better all-round athlete the
world never produced.”</p>

<p>“I hope young Merriwell is square, and a real chip of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_53">53</span>
the old block, as I understand his friends mean to suggest
when they call him ‘Chip’—but, well, I don’t like
the way he has been acting. To-morrow afternoon, uncle,
we may know a lot more about him and about Darrel,
too.”</p>

<p>“Very well,” said the colonel, though reluctantly, “we’ll
leave the matter, Jode, as you desire.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, sir,” said Lenning gratefully.</p>

<p>Why was Lenning so anxious to have his uncle defer
action against Darrel? Had the packet, wrapped in his
handkerchief and stowed in the breast pocket of his
Norfolk jacket, anything to do with his wish to delay
proceedings? In view of what happened later, this
seemed like the logical explanation.</p>

<small>A JOKE—WITH RESULTS.</small></h2>


<p>Hawkins, the deputy sheriff, had not much to say to
Merriwell during their walk from the mesa back to the
camp. Hawkins was an admirer, and in many ways had
shown himself a true friend, of Frank’s; and, out of the
kindness of his heart and, without divulging any secrets,
he strove to warn him against Darrel.</p>

<p>“They’re talkin’ a heap, down in the camp,” said Hawkins,
“of what a big hit this Darrel person has made with
you. Don’t cotton to him too strong, Merriwell. He
isn’t wuth it.”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?” Frank demanded.</p>

<p>“Between ourselves—the thing not to go any further,
you understand—this Darrel’s nothin’ more than a plain
thief.”</p>

<p>“You’re mistaken, Hawkins,” said Frank, with spirit.
“I can’t believe it.”</p>

<p>“Well, son, you’ll have the proof before you’re many
hours older.”</p>

<p>“Then I’ll wait for the proof, Hawkins; and it will
have to be copper-riveted before I turn against Ellis
Darrel.”</p>

<p>“Jest a warnin’ I’m handing you, Merriwell,” grinned
Hawkins. “And you’re to keep what I said to yourself,
mind.”</p>

<p>“Of course, Hawkins. I’m obliged to you for taking
all this trouble, but you’re mistaken, and will find it out.
It’s the colonel’s business, isn’t it?”</p>

<p>“Now, I’m not sayin’ another word,” answered the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_55">55</span>
deputy, “and maybe I’ve let out more’n I ought to, as
it is.”</p>

<p>That ended the brief conversation, and, while it did
not shake Merriwell’s confidence in Ellis Darrel, nevertheless
it left him with vague forebodings of fresh disaster
hanging over the head of the “boy from Nowhere.”</p>

<p>The members of the rival athletic clubs were carefully
avoiding each other. There was no display of ill feeling,
perhaps because the bad blood had no chance to show
itself, or because the presence of the colonel in the Gold
Hill camp was a restraining influence. Be that as it may,
yet the topic of conversation in both camps was the
hundred-yard dash to be run on the following afternoon.
The object of the race, unique in the annals of sport,
lent the event a fascination which nothing else could
have done. Until ten o’clock the affair was discussed by
the Ophir fellows, and then, agreeable to schedule, lights
went out and the Ophir lads sought their blankets.</p>

<p>By an arrangement, enforced from the very first night
that Frank and his companions went into camp, a watch
of three was posted to look after the live stock and other
property during the night. A trio of lads went on
sentry-go from seven to eleven; when their duty was
finished, they aroused three others to do guard duty from
eleven to three; and these, in turn, awoke three more for
the morning watch from three to seven. On this night,
the first to be passed on the flat with the Gold Hillers,
Ballard was one of the three who had the midwatch of
four hours around midnight. Ballard’s post was in the
cañon, just below the flat, where the saddle and pack stock
had been gathered.</p>

<p>He had a lonely vigil for an hour. Somewhere in the
neighboring hills the coyotes were howling—a noise, by
the way, not calculated to soothe a person’s nerves.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_56">56</span>
While Ballard was listening to the coyotes, and thinking
more or less about the next day’s race, he heard a sound
as of some one sliding down the slope from the flat.
Alert on the instant, Ballard started up and peered into
the gloom and listened. Some one was breathing heavily
and floundering and stumbling through bushes and over
stones.</p>

<p>“Can’t be a prowler,” murmured Ballard, “for he’s
making too much noise. I’ll just lay hands on the fellow
and make him give an account of himself.”</p>

<p>Creeping forward, and screening himself as well as he
could in the shadows, Ballard was able to rise up suddenly
and seize the wabbling figure.</p>

<p>“<i lang ="de">Himmelblitzen!</i>” wheezed a voice. “Oof you peen
vone oof der Inchun shpooks, den I bet you I faint fits
righdt on der shpot! Whoosh!” and the voice died
away with a suggestion of chattering teeth.</p>

<p>“Carrots!” laughed Ballard. “Say, you crazy chump,
what are you fooling around the gulch for at this time
of night?”</p>

<p>“Oh, Pallard!” puffed Fritz, in great relief. “Vell,
vell, vat a habbiness! Dere vas t’ings vich ve don’d
know till ve findt dem oudt, hey? I vas looking for you,
Pallard, yah, so helup me!”</p>

<p>“Looking for me?” echoed Ballard; “what for?”</p>

<p>“Meppyso I gif you haluf oof dot dreasure oof you go
along und hellup me get him.”</p>

<p>“Oh, blazes!” chuckled Ballard. “I thought you’d got
over that treasure notion, Carrots.”</p>

<p>“Lisden, vonce, und I told you someding.” Fritz
dropped his voice to an explosive whisper.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_57">57</span> “Vat you
dink? Py shiminy, so sure as nodding I findt me dot
shtone mit der gross on. Yah, you bed my life! It
vas so blain as I can’t tell, Pallard. Aber ven I roll avay
der shtone und tig mit der shovel, I hear me some voices
oof an Inchun chief. Dot shkared me avay. Haf you
got der nerfs to go mit me to der blace back, Pallard? I
peen shaky all ofer, und my shkin geds oop und valks
on me mit coldt feet, yet I bed you I go back, und I
findt der dreasure. You come, und so hellup me I gif
you haluf!”</p>

<p>The excitement at the Wells, incident to the arrival
of the Gold Hillers and following hard upon the rapid
return of Fritz and Silva to the camp, had temporarily
closed the fun Merry and his friends had had in the
cañon. More important events had claimed the attention
of the lads who had participated in the joke, and no
one had explained matters to Fritz or the Mexican. So
it chanced that the Dutchman was still laboring under
his delusion.</p>

<p>Ballard wondered whether he had better set Fritz
right, or keep the joke going. He finally decided that
the stock would not suffer if he played out the Dutchman
a little, and watched his antics in the supposedly
spook-haunted gulch.</p>

<p>“When an Injun goes to the happy hunting grounds,
Carrots,” remarked Ballard gravely, “it’s just as well
not to stir him up. I’d hate to have a red spook get a
strangle hold on me—there wouldn’t be treasure enough
in the whole of Arizona to pay a fellow for an experience
of that kind.”</p>

<p>“Haf you no chincher?” demanded Fritz.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_58">58</span> “Iss it not
vort’ a leedle shcare chust to load oop mit goldt dot vill
make you a rich mans for life, hey? Vell, I bed you!
I t’ink him all oudt, und I arrife py der gonglusion dot
a shpook iss nodding more as a shadow in der sun, oder
der moon. Vat a shpook does makes no odds aboudt der
tifference. Ve go, ve ged der goldt, und ve come back.
Dot’s all aboudt it. I got me a shovel in vone handt,
und a glub in der odder. Mit vone, I tig oop der goldt;
mit der odder, I knock ofer der shpooks. Und dere you
vas. Ve shall be gompany mit each odder, Pallard.”</p>

<p>“I don’t see how I can back out, Carrots,” said Ballard,
“the way you put it up to me. You’re an awful
persuader. How much gold is there?”</p>

<p>“I see it in der tream dot dere iss more as ve can carry,
yes.”</p>

<p>“Maybe that dream is just fooling you, Carrots.”</p>

<p>“You say yourselluf dot treams iss somet’ing, Pallard.”</p>

<p>“Did I? Well, maybe they are something. You go
first, will you, Carrots? I’ve got a weak heart, and if
I should run onto a spook without any warning it would
knock me stiff.”</p>

<p>“I vill go fairst,” agreed Fritz, generously and valiantly,
“und you precede. I vill vatch aroundt carefully, und
oof ve don’d make some noises, den meppy der shpooks
von’t hear, und ve gif dem der slip.”</p>

<p>Fritz waddled off into the darkness, and Ballard, enjoying
himself hugely, trailed after him. Suddenly,
without the least warning, Fritz dropped the shovel and
the club, whirled in his tracks, and took Ballard in a convulsive
embrace.</p>

<p>“<i lang ="de">Ach, du lieber!</i>” he whimpered. “I hear me someding,
py shiminy! Lisden, vonce, Pallard! Vat it iss,
hey?”</p>

<p>“Coyotes,” answered Ballard, in a smothered voice.
“Brace up, Carrots. Don’t lose your nerve.”</p>

<p>“Sooch dreasure hundings I don’d like,” mumbled Fritz,
slowly untangling himself from Ballard and cautiously
groping for his shovel and club.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_59">59</span> “I vish der plame’
coyotes vould go to shleep. Ach, vat a nervousness I
got all droo me. I shake like I hat some agues. Sooch
a pitzness iss vort’ all der dreasures vat ve findt.”</p>

<p>Suddenly Ballard, clapping a hand over Fritz’s mouth,
whispered a hissing warning for him to keep still, and
pulled him out of the narrow trail and in between a
couple of huge bowlders.</p>

<p>“V-v-vat iss der drouple!” inquired Fritz feebly. “You
see a shpook yourselluf, Pallard? I bed you——”</p>

<p>Again Ballard clapped a hand to his companion’s
mouth.</p>

<p>“Sh-h-h!” he murmured. “There’s some one coming,
right behind us. Not a word, now; not so much as a
whisper.”</p>

<p>Somehow, Ballard got it into his head that the man
who was following them was Silva. The Mexican, he
remembered, was also mixed up, rather vaguely, with
Fritz in the treasure hunting. Ballard had it in mind
to give Silva a bit of a scare, and so make the most of
that midnight experience.</p>

<p>Peering out from their dark retreat, Fritz and Ballard
saw a dark figure gliding toward them along the
trail. It was impossible for them to discover who the
man was. He was in a hurry, that was evident, and a
peculiar, musical jingling accompanied him as he came
on. The sound was not loud, but more like a tinkling
whisper, and barely distinguishable.</p>

<p>But Silva—if Silva it was—did not pass the two behind
the bowlders. He halted, so close that Ballard
could have reached out and touched him, went down on
his knees, and worked at something in the dark. Even
with the fellow so near, the heavy gloom successfully
hid his identity.</p>

<p>Ballard’s desire for fun was lost in a mighty curiosity.
The fellow took something white from his pocket,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_60">60</span>
and, apparently, pushed it under a stone; then, rising, he
sped away in the direction from whence he had come.</p>

<p>“Vell, vell!” muttered Fritz. “Vat you t’ink iss dot,
Pallard?”</p>

<p>“That’s a conundrum, Carrots. How many fellows
are looking for that treasure of yours, eh?”</p>

<p>“No vone but me und you, Pallard.”</p>

<p>“Wait here for a couple of shakes, Fritz. I want to
explore.”</p>

<p>Ballard crept to the place where the mysterious figure
had been at work, groped under a stone, and pulled
forth a package wrapped in something white. Lighting
a match, he examined his find. Fritz could hear him
muttering excitedly as the match dropped from his
fingers.</p>

<p>“Vat it iss, Pallard?” quavered Fritz.</p>

<p>“I’ve had enough treasure hunting for one night,” answered
Ballard, in a strange voice. “I’m going back to
the live stock, Fritz. Come on!”</p>

<p>Fritz protested, but Ballard stood firm. Fritz would
not continue on without company, and so they returned
to the camp—Ballard with the white packet snugly
stowed in his pocket.</p>

<small>THE RACE.</small></h2>


<p>Most of the forenoon, every day except Sunday, Merriwell,
Clancy, and Ballard had to give up to the “grind.”
Professor Phineas Borrodaile rigidly insisted on certain
hours for study and recitation, and would not temper
his discipline even on the day that notable race was to
be run between Lenning and Darrel.</p>

<p>Following breakfast, each camp continued to flock by
itself. The live stock belonging to each party was
picketed in widely separated grazing grounds, so there
was no opportunity for Silva and the other packer to
wind up their disagreements in a final clash. Peace hovered
over the region adjacent to Tinaja Wells, but to
Merry it suggested a calm preceding a storm.</p>

<p>Hawkins buried himself among the Gold Hillers, and
seemed very careful not to overstep the “dead line” which
had been drawn between the two camps. Colonel Hawtrey
also appeared content to remain in seclusion among
the members of his own party.</p>

<p>About eleven o’clock in the forenoon, Frank and his
chums, and the professor and Darrel overheard a brief
address which the old soldier was making to the young
athletes of the Gold Hill club. Only scraps of the colonel’s
little speech floated to the fellows in the Ophir
tent, but what they overheard made a deep impression
on them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_62">62</span></p>
<p>“Sports of the right kind, properly indulged in, are of
vastly more benefit to the upbuilding of character, my
young friends, than to your muscles and bodily endurance.
Understand me, I do not say that physical development
is of less importance than mental development.
Both of these should proceed hand in hand; but
if, over all, the moral and manly qualities do not grow
as they should, all your training in the class and on
the track and field will have been in vain. Try, my
lads, to develop the faculty of being good losers, and to
admire and applaud in others those abilities, natural or
acquired, which you possess, but not in the same degree.”</p>

<p>As these words, spoken in a deep and earnest voice,
wafted themselves from the rival camp, the professor
softly clapped his hands.</p>

<p>“Noble sentiments most nobly expressed, young gentlemen,”
he murmured. “This Colonel Hawtrey must
surely be a man of splendid character.”</p>

<p>“He is,” said Darrel, in a low voice. “The colonel is
one of the finest men that ever lived.”</p>

<p>“Listen!” whispered the professor.</p>

<p>Again the colonel’s words drifted into the rival camp:</p>

<p>“If an amateur athlete is not a true sportsman, which
is but another term for gentleman, he is not fit to compete
with other true sportsmen. Your real gentleman,
if you please, has courage; but, more than that, he is so
imbued with the spirit of fair play and so completely
captain of his own soul, that the stings of honorable defeat
leave him unscathed.”</p>

<p>These were fine words, and well calculated to inspire
a spirit of high emprise.</p>

<p>“I hope Jode is taking that in,” whispered Darrel to
Merriwell; “but, I’ll gamble my spurs, he’s going to beat
the pistol, just the same.”</p>

<p>Ballard, all that morning, had been preoccupied to an
extent that had drawn some criticism from the professor.
The interesting events of the night, which he had not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_63">63</span>
only kept a secret himself but had likewise warned
Fritz to keep in the background, probably had a good
deal to do with his poor showing at the problems put up
to him by Borrodaile.</p>

<p>At eleven-thirty, when the studious ones were allowed
a breathing spell before dinner, Ballard hooked onto
Merriwell and led him to a secluded place for a talk.
Fritz had to call them three times to “grub pile,” and
when the two finally arrived, their faces were flushed with
excitement, and there was an air about them that suggested
mysterious things.</p>

<p>At two-thirty in the afternoon a general movement
set in toward the mesa. Both camps emptied themselves
upon the little plateau, so that nearly forty spectators assembled
to watch the race between Darrel and Lenning.</p>

<p>The course had already been marked off by Brad,
Spink, and Handy. Beman, for Lenning, had looked it
over and pronounced it O.  K. On one side of this course
the Gold Hill men were grouped, and on the other side
the fellows from Ophir.</p>

<p>Colonel Hawtrey and Hawkins stood together, and
Merriwell, for the first time, got a good look at the
colonel. He was much impressed with his soldierly bearing,
but in his face could be read sternness and determination—and
a sadness which did not, in the least, diminish
the more Spartan qualities.</p>

<p>Bleeker, of Gold Hill, crossed the course and stepped
up to Merriwell.</p>

<p>“There ought to be a judge and a starter, I reckon,”
said he. “I don’t see any need of makin’ this event top-heavy
with officials. Do you?”</p>

<p>“Not at all,” Frank answered. “I’d suggest that Colonel
Hawtrey act as judge of the race.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_64">64</span></p>
<p>“He says he won’t have a thing to do with it.”</p>

<p>“Then how about Hawkins, the deputy sheriff?”</p>

<p>“Suits Lenning to a t, y, ty. Lenning would like to
have Beman for starter.”</p>

<p>Merriwell was expecting this, and yet it came to him
with something like surprise. It pointed to crookedness
on the part of Lenning—and after that fine talk the
colonel had given his fellows that morning, too!</p>

<p>“Let Beman act as starter, then,” assented Frank,
keeping to the plan broached by Darrel.</p>

<p>Bleeker hurried away to inform Hawkins and Beman
of the work laid out for them; and a few minutes later
Darrel and Lenning, in sprinting costumes, came trotting
up from the camp.</p>

<p>Merriwell watched Darrel and the colonel. As the old
soldier fixed his eyes on his discredited nephew, a queer
play of emotions showed in his face. In Darrel’s look
was a wistfulness and affection which caused his uncle
to turn abruptly and gaze in another direction.</p>

<p>Beman, a round-shouldered, lanky chap, stepped out
back of the starting line, pistol in hand.</p>

<p>“All ready, you two?” he called.</p>

<p>Darrel and Lenning answered by stepping to the line.
Not a sound of approval or disapproval went up from
the gathered throng. Silence reigned on the mesa.</p>

<p>“This is about as cheerful as a funeral procession,
Chip,” muttered Clancy.</p>

<p>“Everybody’s mightily interested in the race, for all
they have bottled up their feelings,” Merriwell answered.</p>

<p>“Maybe,” was the skeptical response,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_65">65</span> “but it takes a
lot of rooters to stir up the enthusiasm. This looks about
as sporty as the track event of a deaf-and-dumb school.
That Lenning carries himself well. He walks with a
spring that leads you to think he ‘feels his feet.’ But I
don’t like the cut of his jib a little bit.”</p>

<p>“Nor I. His eyes are shifty, and his face doesn’t inspire
much confidence.”</p>

<p>“The old colonel is about as hilarious as he would be
trying to hunt up a nephew in the morgue. Whoo! I’ll
go dippy in a minute if somebody doesn’t yell. Guess I’ll
tear off a whoop myself.”</p>

<p>He suited his action to the word, but it was a melancholy
effort. No one joined in with him, not even Merry
or Ballard. From across the course, the Gold Hillers
gave him a startled look of disapproval.</p>

<p>“Once will do, thanks,” muttered Clancy. “I’m frosted
so badly I’ve got chilblains. Why doesn’t that starter
set ’em off?”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of Clancy’s mouth before
Beman shouted: “On your mark!”</p>

<p>Both sprinters dropped in well-nigh perfect style.</p>

<p>“Set!”</p>

<p>With that word, and the tense preparations of the
sprinters for the start, Merry and Brad began watching
Lenning keenly. Merry ticked off the seconds in his
mind—one, two, three—and then intuitively he sensed
the forward plunge of Lenning, coming a fraction of a
second before the crack of the pistol. Lenning had not
waited to hear the pistol, and had got away at the explosion.</p>

<p>“He did it, by thunder!” whispered Brad. “Darrel had
the skunk dead to rights. Eh, Chip?”</p>

<p>“No doubt about it, Brad!”</p>

<p>Further talk just then was out of the question. The
first stride of the race had taken Lenning into the lead,
and Darrel, waiting honorably for the signal to start,
was rushing to overhaul his competitor.</p>

<p>“Dig, you kid from Nowhere!” whooped Clancy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_66">66</span> “The
race isn’t done till you breast the tape.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Darrel!” Merriwell shouted. “You’ll pass
him at the eighty-yard line!”</p>

<p>“Wow!” yelped Ballard; “I’ll bet the boy from Nowhere
gets Somewhere before he’s many seconds older.”</p>

<p>A murmur went up from the Gold Hill side of the
course. The peculiar form in which Darrel was racing
was recognized. Various little mannerisms connected
with his sprinting were recalled. They were all here, in
this clean-cut athlete whom Lenning had declared an impostor!
Gold Hill sentiments, it was plain, were undergoing
a change.</p>

<p>Not the least interested observer in the Gold Hill crowd
was the colonel. He leaned forward, the joy of wholesome
sport temporarily brushing aside the sterner proceedings
which were to wait upon the finish of that
hundred-yard dash. The object of that race—the “boy
from Nowhere’s” attempt to prove his identity—did not
concern Colonel Hawtrey. He knew Lenning’s competitor
was Ellis Darrel, race or no race. What flamed
up in him, as he gazed spellbound, was a pure love of
track athletics, aroused by a contest that was superb.</p>

<p>In about four seconds after the start the Gold Hillers
had loosened up. There were cries of, “Go it, Darrel!”
and, “This looks like old times, Curly!” which proved
that Darrel was already winning the recognition he coveted,
no matter whether he won or lost the dash.</p>

<p>At the eighty-yard line, just as Merry had prophesied,
Darrel drew ahead of Lenning. The latter called on his
reserve powers for a final spurt, but Darrel also had speed
in reserve. In ten seconds, or a trifle more or less, Darrel
tore away the tape at the finish, a full stride in the lead.</p>

<p>A roar went up from all sides. The enthusiasm, which
had been held in check, rushed forth like a tidal wave.
A rush was made toward Darrel, but Hawkins, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_67">67</span>
deputy sheriff, grim and relentless, waved the throng
back. Stepping to the side of the victor, he dropped an
official hand on his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Youngster,” said he crisply, “I’m sorry a heap to come
down hard on you at a time like this, but you’re under
arrest.”</p>

<p>“Arrest?” echoed Darrel, recoiling. “For what?”</p>

<p>“For openin’ your uncle’s safe an’ stealin’ a thousand
in cold cash. Don’t make a fuss, bec’us’ it won’t do you
any good.”</p>

<p>Then, amid the dead hush that fell over the mesa,
Darrel’s eyes sought only one face in all the crowd surrounding
him. And that face was Merriwell’s!</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_68">68</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_X" id="CHAPTER_X">CHAPTER X.</a><br />

<small>A HELPING HAND.</small></h2>


<p>The explosion of a bomb could not have caused greater
consternation among the throng on the mesa than that
official action of the deputy sheriff. Hawtrey, erect and
with a soldierly stride, passed out of the stunned crowd
and placed himself beside Hawkins.</p>

<p>Merriwell, giving Darrel a reassuring look, also advanced.
He had a sweater on his arm, and began pulling
it over Darrel’s head and shoulders.</p>

<p>“You’d better keep out of this, Merriwell,” Hawkins
murmured in Frank’s ear. “I warned you. The kunnel
means biz, and no mistake.”</p>

<p>“So do I,” Frank answered, with a flash of his dark
eyes. “Keep your nerve,” he added, in a low tone to
Darrel; “we’ve got a few cards of our own to play.”</p>

<p>“You are Frank Merriwell?” inquired Colonel Hawtrey,
leveling his gaze at Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes, colonel.”</p>

<p>“The son of Frank Merriwell, of Bloomfield, and the
T-Bar Ranch, in Wyoming?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“You are also seeking to befriend this misguided young
man, here?”</p>

<p>“I am Darrel’s friend,” said Merry, with spirit, “right
from the drop of the hat.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_69">69</span></p>
<p>“Then, my lad, your father will some time hear of it
with regret. What Hawkins said is the truth. This fellow
opened my safe and took from it a thousand dollars
in cash night before last. I have the proof.”</p>

<p>“Pardon me, colonel,” returned Frank respectfully,
“but inasmuch as I am Darrel’s friend, will you let me
handle this case for him in my own way?”</p>

<p>“If you mean to defend him,” frowned Hawtrey, “you
will have your trouble for your pains. He has no defense!”</p>

<p>“Will you let me try and see if I cannot make one, and
one that will command your attention and best judgment?”</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ centipedes, Merriwell!” broke in Hawkins.
“I never reckoned you’d be tryin’ to save the scalp of
a plain, out-and-out thief!”</p>

<p>The white ran into Darrel’s face and his hands
clenched. Merry laid a soothing hand on his arm.</p>

<p>“This isn’t a time for any snap judgments, Hawkins,”
said Frank. “First,” and he turned to the Gold Hillers,
“I want to ask if this boy from Nowhere has proved
that he is Ellis Darrel, of Gold Hill?”</p>

<p>“Yes!” came a chorus of responses.</p>

<p>Merry partly turned to face Lenning. The latter, a
sneering smile on his dark face, was standing at a little
distance, keenly alive to everything that was said and
done.</p>

<p>“How about you, Lenning?” queried Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s my half brother, all right,” was the answer. “I
reckon there’s not a shadow of doubt about that.”</p>

<p>“You agree, too, colonel?”</p>

<p>“I knew the fellow was Darrel before the race,” answered
Hawtrey. “If he had proved to be an impostor,
this accusation of theft might not have carried. Now
it is absolutely proven—ab-so-lutely.”</p>

<p>“Darrel has been accused here, before all his old
friends,” Frank continued, marshaling all his wits to
acquit himself creditably of the task of clearing Darrel,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_70">70</span>
“and it’s only a fair shake that he should be proven innocent
before them. Colonel, will you please tell us of
the robbery, and show your proofs?”</p>

<p>Hawtrey was visibly annoyed. Nevertheless, he was a
great stickler for fair play, and he had to acknowledge
that the position taken by Merry was logical.</p>

<p>“I have been away from Gold Hill for a week,” said
he, “visiting some of my mining properties. Before I
went, I drew a thousand dollars in cash from the bank
to pay to a man from whom I was purchasing an interest
in a ‘prospect.’ I was called from town hurriedly,
before the payment was made. The money was locked
up in the safe in my study, at home. Jode, here, who
knows the combination of the safe, was to pay over the
money if the man presented himself during my absence.
The man did not come, and Jode started off on this
camping trip, three days ago. When I reached home
yesterday morning, I found the window of my study unlocked,
the safe door swinging open, the thousand dollars
gone, and this knife lying under the window, inside
the room. Hand the knife to Darrel, Merriwell, and see
if he recognizes it.”</p>

<p>The colonel seemed averse to having any direct dealings
with Darrel. He gave the pocketknife to Frank, and
the latter presented it to Hawkins’ prisoner.</p>

<p>“It’s mine,” admitted Darrel huskily.</p>

<p>“Haff, an official of our athletic club, told Hawkins
and me,” the colonel proceeded,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_71">71</span> “that a fellow answering
Darrel’s description had been in town the night before I
got home, that he had made inquiries about me, that he
had told the fellow I was away from home, and that Jode
was off on a camping trip, and that Darrel started down
the cañon to join the Gold Hill campers. Hawkins and
I got horses and hurried on to Tinaja Wells. Ask Darrel,
Merriwell, if he denies being in my house night before
last?”</p>

<p>“No, colonel,” spoke up Darrel, without waiting for
Merriwell to put the question, “I do not deny it. I was
there. I pushed open the sash lock with this knife, and
went in through your study and up to my old room. I
had the key to my room—have had it in my pocket for
a year. All I wanted to get was my running suit. After
I had taken that, I locked up the room and left by the
window. Naturally, I could not relock the window from
the outside. That’s all, sir. I did not tamper with your
safe.”</p>

<p>A sneer of incredulity crossed Lenning’s face. It
faded into a sorrowful look, however, as the colonel gave
him a swift glance.</p>

<p>“You admit being in the house,” said the colonel
harshly, “so why not admit the rest of it?”</p>

<p>“Because it is not the truth,” Darrel answered, with
spirit.</p>

<p>“Did you know the combination of the safe, Darrel?”
asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Yes—that is, if it hasn’t been changed during the
past year.”</p>

<p>“It hasn’t,” put in the colonel. “That was my fault, I
suppose.”</p>

<p>“Then, three of you knew the combination,” went on
Frank, “yourself, colonel, and Darrel and Lenning.”</p>

<p>“That is the way of it.”</p>

<p>The crowd on the mesa was listening with absorbed
attention to the talk which was going forward over the
hapless head of the “boy from Nowhere.” Nearly all,
perhaps, felt that Darrel’s admission that he had gone
to the house for his running suit was a trivial excuse
to cover a design on the safe. Dark looks were thrown<span class="pagenum" id="Page_72">72</span>
at Darrel, and only here and there was anything bordering
on sympathy shown for him.</p>

<p>“Now,” said Frank, keeping the points he wanted to
make well in mind and working toward them with all the
skill he could muster, “you said, colonel, that Lenning
and his camping party left Gold Hill three days ago?”</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Less than half a day would be required to make the
trip from Gold Hill to Tinaja Wells, for a mounted party
with pack animals. How does it happen, then, that the
Gold Hillers only reached the Wells yesterday afternoon?”</p>

<p>Colonel Hawtrey seemed puzzled. He turned to Lenning.</p>

<p>“Explain that, will you, Jode?” he requested. “Why
didn’t you reach the Wells day before yesterday?”</p>

<p>“Well, sir,” Lenning answered, “we were about halfway
between town and Tinaja Wells when we found out
that Merriwell and his crowd were camped at the place
we wanted.”</p>

<p>“Ah! And what did you do then?”</p>

<p>“I had the boys make temporary camp in a side cañon
while I—er—went back to Gold Hill.”</p>

<p>“That,” said Frank, “would bring you in Gold Hill
night before last—the night of the robbery?”</p>

<p>Lenning reddened and looked confused.</p>

<p>“Why,” he faltered, “I reckon it would.”</p>

<p>“What was your business in Gold Hill, Lenning?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know,” snapped Lenning, “that you’ve got any
call to pump me.”</p>

<p>“Answer his question, Jode,” put in the colonel.</p>

<p>“Well, if you want to know,” scowled Lenning,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_73">73</span> “I
went back to the Hill to lease Tinaja Wells from
Struthers.”</p>

<p>A growl ran through the ranks of the Ophirites. Frank
silenced the growing indignation with a quick glance.</p>

<p>“That was hardly fair,” he went on to Lenning. “We
were in peaceable possession of the camping ground, and
you deliberately set about getting a lease and kicking
us out.”</p>

<p>“Tut, tut, Merriwell!” interposed Hawtrey. “Jode is
not that sort of a lad. I am sure he would not intentionally
inconvenience you.”</p>

<p>“Ouch!” cried Clancy, and the colonel stared sternly
at him in rebuke.</p>

<p>“Well,” went on Frank, “we’ll not tangle up with that
part of the proposition. The fact remains that, on the
night of the robbery, two persons who knew the combination
of your safe were in Gold Hill. As soon as
Lenning got his lease, he came on to Tinaja Wells—which
brought him here yesterday afternoon. Now,
colonel, why do you suspect Darrel, and not Lenning?”</p>

<p>“Because,” and the colonel’s voice showed that he was
nettled. “Jode is worthy of my confidence, while Darrel
has proved that he is not. Were you at the house, Jode,
during the time you were in Gold Hill after the lease?”</p>

<p>“No, sir,” answered Lenning.</p>

<p>“There you have it,” said the colonel, in a tone of
finality. “All this talk, Merriwell, is getting us nowhere.
I have excused Darrel once, but I cannot do it
a second time. Although he is my sister’s son, he must
bear the consequences of this piece of wrongdoing. I
feel it a duty to press the matter to an issue. Where
will he end if he keeps on as he is going?”</p>

<p>There was a triumphant look on Lenning’s face. Darrel,
on the other hand, seemed utterly crushed.</p>

<p>“There’s no use, Merriwell,” breathed Darrel, in a<span class="pagenum" id="Page_74">74</span>
broken voice. “The plot is too deep, and you are only
injuring yourself by trying to defend me.”</p>

<p>“Kunnel,” spoke up Hawkins, who had been following
every angle of Frank’s work with closest attention, “don’t
you lay anythin’ up agin’ Merriwell. He’s sized Darrel
up wrong, but he’s the clear quill, as I happen to know.”</p>

<p>“I have only the highest respect for Merriwell,” said
the colonel. “He tries to stand by his friends to the
utmost of his ability—and his ability, let me tell you, is
of no mean order. But, my lad, you can accomplish
nothing in the face of the facts,” he added, in a kindly
voice, to Frank.</p>

<p>“Let us see,” Frank went on. “Pink,” he said to Ballard,
“just step up and show the colonel what you have
in your pocket.”</p>

<p>Then another surprise was sprung. Ballard, taking a
package of bills from his pocket, handed it to the colonel.</p>

<p>“Is that the stolen money, colonel?” he asked.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_75">75</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XI" id="CHAPTER_XI">CHAPTER XI.</a><br />

<small>A PARTIAL VICTORY.</small></h2>


<p>The colonel started back from the package of bills as
though from a coiled and striking serpent. A breath of
icy air seemed to cross the hot mesa, bringing a weird
shiver to more than one of the crowd surrounding the
actors in that little drama of check and countercheck.
Necks were craned forward, and fascinated interest
showed in every face.</p>

<p>But there was something more than interest in the face
of Jode Lenning. A flicker of consternation, and of
wild despair, pulsed through his features—but only for
a moment. He was quick to get himself in hand.</p>

<p>“It—it’s the same package of bills which I drew from
the bank,” murmured the distracted colonel, taking the
bundle from Ballard and looking at the inclosing band.
“Where did you get it, young man?”</p>

<p>“He’s a chum of Merriwell’s,” spoke up Lenning, with
ugly significance, “and Merriwell is helping Darrel. It’s
easy to guess where Ballard got the money.”</p>

<p>Ballard jumped for Lenning with a savage exclamation.</p>

<p>“You mealy-mouthed runt,” he cried, “you can’t plaster
me with the same pitch you’ve got on yourself. I’ll——”</p>

<p>Merriwell leaped in between Ballard and Lenning.</p>

<p>“Now, Pink,” said Merry, “just stow your temper.
We’ve got to keep our heads, you know, if we pull Darrel
through. It’s Colonel Hawtrey we want to convince, not
Jode Lenning.”</p>

<p>Ballard, with a fierce, warning glance at Lenning, drew
back.</p>

<p>“Fritz!” called Frank.</p>

<p>“On teck, you bed you,” boomed the Dutch boy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_76">76</span></p>

<p>“Where were you last night, Carrots?” inquired Frank.</p>

<p>“Hunding puried dreasures mit Pallard,” beamed
Fritz. “I haf a tream mit meinselluf dot I findt more
goldt as I can tell a shtone under mit a gross on. Pallard
goes mit me, last nighdt, to get der dreasure. Ve go
down der gulch, und ven ve vas a leetle vays from der
camp, along comes a feller pehind us alretty. Ve hite,
und dot feller hites der money under a rock. Ve get him
oudt, und Pallard takes him, und ve keep it on der
q. ts., excepting dot it vas toldt to Merrivell. Dot’s all
aboudt it.”</p>

<p>“What foolishness is this?” demanded the colonel.</p>

<p>Merry smilingly explained Fritz’s delusion about buried
treasure, and how a joke had been played upon him and
Silva, in the cañon. Then Ballard, dipping into the details,
recited his midnight adventure with Fritz. Ballard
threw so much fun into his account that more than one
laugh went up from the bystanders. A little merriment,
dropped into a serious situation, is an excellent thing occasionally.</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said the colonel, “you could not be the
son of your father and be anything else but trustworthy.
I do not know your father personally, but I have seen him
pitch many a game of ball, and I honor him as a man,
and as one of the greatest wizards of the national game
that ever lived. All this nonsense about the German
youth and his buried treasure makes not the least impression
on me; but, if you say that this money came into
Ballard’s hands in the manner just described to me, I will
believe it.”</p>

<p>“You have heard the exact truth, colonel,” answered
Frank, thrilled at this expression of the colonel’s confidence
in him.</p>

<p>“Very good,” went on Hawtrey. “Now, Ballard,” he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_77">77</span>
continued, facing Pink, “who was the man you and the
German youth saw hiding the money in the cañon?”</p>

<p>“Neither of us was able to recognize him, colonel,”
Ballard answered.</p>

<p>“What?” cried the colonel. “You could not recognize
the fellow when you, by your own statement, were
close enough to reach out and touch him?”</p>

<p>“Remember, sir, that it was midnight, and that the
walls of the cañon make the trail pretty dark. I couldn’t
tell who the fellow was from Adam, and that’s the
truth.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you spring upon him and capture him?”</p>

<p>“You forget, colonel,” put in Frank, “that the fellow
was gone before Ballard and Fritz found out what he
had cached. And you also forget that, at that time, none
of us knew that Darrel was suspected of robbing your
safe—or, for that matter, that any robbery had occurred.
Another thing: Last night Darrel was sleeping in our
tent, in a blanket bed between Clancy and me. He could
not have stirred without wakening us. From ten o’clock
last night until six this morning Ellis Darrel never left
that tent.”</p>

<p>“Then, of course,” deduced the colonel, “he could not
have been the one who hid the money.”</p>

<p>“Nor the one who took it from your safe, sir,” added
Merriwell; “for the one who did the stealing must certainly
have kept the money in his hands until he attempted
to secrete it in the cañon.”</p>

<p>“That,” said the colonel, “is plausible, but not conclusive.
Darrel might have given the money to some one
to take care of for him, and that some one may have
been the person who hid it under the rock. I do not say
that this is so,” he added, “but that it might have happened.
As the matter now stands, the whole thing is<span class="pagenum" id="Page_78">78</span>
a mystery. By your excellent work, Merriwell, you have
thrown doubt upon my suspicions of Darrel. Possibly—I
may say probably—he had no hand in taking the money
from my safe. But who did commit the robbery?”</p>

<p>“I reckon Merriwell’s right,” spoke up Hawkins, his
face glowing with delight over the way Frank had conducted
the defense of Darrel. “You never could send
this feller up, kunnel, agin’ the showing Merriwell has
made for him.”</p>

<p>“I shall not try to,” said Hawtrey. “I am happier than
I know how to express over the outcome of this little
conference here on the mesa.”</p>

<p>Impulsively Darrel started toward his uncle with outstretched
hand.</p>

<p>“Uncle Alvah,” said he, his voice tremulous with emotion,
“I thank you for giving me any consideration at all.
I——”</p>

<p>The colonel, giving Darrel a stern look, put his hands
behind him.</p>

<p>“Thank Merriwell,” said he curtly, “and not me. You
are freed of this charge of robbery, but you are just
where you were before, in my estimation—just where you
were when that railroad accident was reported to us,
and everybody believed you had been a victim of it. I
have tried to forget you, for that thing you did, more
than a year ago, is something I cannot overlook, or forgive.
However, I am not willing that you should be
penniless; I feel that I should make up to you, in some
way, for the unpleasant position in which my suspicions
placed you. Take this thousand dollars, Darrel, and try,
from now on, to be a true sportsman. Cultivate Merriwell—he
will point you along the right road. But as
long as you are under that cloud—you know what I<span class="pagenum" id="Page_79">79</span>
mean—there can be nothing in common between you and
me. That is all.”</p>

<p>The colonel’s form was bowed, as he turned away, and
there were lines of suffering in his face. He had flung
down the packet of bank notes, but Darrel caught it up
and ran after him.</p>

<p>“Your money is of no use to me, colonel,” he said, with
a touch of pride, “and I want none of it. I can work and
earn my own way, just as I have done for the last year.”</p>

<p>There were tears in his eyes as he thrust the money into
the colonel’s hand and came back to Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Chip,” said Clancy, “here’s where you win and lose,
both at the same time. You’ve kept Darrel out of Hawkins’
hands, but you haven’t been able to win over that
high-strung old boy to Darrel’s side.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” said Frank, taking Darrel’s hand, “that will
come later. We——”</p>

<p>“Look!” called Ballard, pointing off toward the edge
of the mesa. “There’s a man on horseback just riding
up from the flat and handing something to Hawtrey.
What’s this? Another knock for Darrel?”</p>

<p>“I reckon,” returned Darrel, with a wan smile, “that
I’ve had about all the knocks I’m entitled to. Merriwell,
you’re a friend worth having!”</p>

<p>“Whoosh!” laughed Frank. “I’m a pretty bum lawyer,
Darrel, and only won out because we had such a clear
case. Surprised you, didn’t we?”</p>

<p>Before Darrel could answer, Colonel Hawtrey was
seen to turn back from the edge of the mesa and start
toward the crowd that still lingered about the scene of
the race. He held an open letter in his hand.</p>

<p>“Here’s where the lightning strikes again,” muttered
Clancy.</p>

<small>THE DOVE OF PEACE.</small></h2>


<p>“Friends,” said the colonel, as those on the mesa clustered
around him, “a messenger has just arrived from
Gold Hill bringing me a note from Struthers. He has
lost his lawsuit against Packard, and consequently his
claim to Tinaja Wells is null and void. Inasmuch as
our party holds a lease from Struthers, there is nothing
left for the Gold Hill campers but to pack up and look
for some other camping ground. I do not think, Merriwell,”
the colonel added, thrusting the letter into his
pocket, “that this can be done before to-morrow, but
Jode and his friends will leave at the earliest possible
moment.”</p>

<p>“Take your time about it, colonel,” Frank answered;
and then he went on to Darrel, Clancy, and Ballard:
“And so, fellows, the dove of peace swoops down on
Tinaja Wells.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad as blazes Jode is getting out of here,” said
Darrel. “I reckon, though, that I’ll have to pick up
and begin drifting again.”</p>

<p>“No, you don’t,” returned Frank; “that is,” he laughed,
“not unless you’re tired of this Ophir bunch and want
to get away from us.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to stick around and sponge a living
off you fellows.”</p>

<p>“Never mind that, Darrel. If you’re around, we’ll
make you work. Perhaps we can do something to wipe
out that forgery business.”</p>

<p>“That’s a large order,” said Darrel gloomily.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_81">81</span> “I doubt
if I ever get to the bottom of that.”</p>

<p>“Well, consider this,” pursued Merry. “Isn’t it possible
that the skunk who put up that robbery dodge on you
may have had something to do with the forging of that
check?”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, it’s possible. But who was back of the
robbery? Ballard and Fritz couldn’t see who the fellow
was.”</p>

<p>“We didn’t produce all our evidence, in clearing you,
for the good and sufficient reason that we didn’t want
to bear down too hard on Jode—just at present. We may
need him in our business later.”</p>

<p>“Jode?” echoed Darrel wonderingly. “What has he
to——”</p>

<p>“When the money was found by Ballard,” broke in
Frank, “it was wrapped in a handkerchief. That handkerchief
had been to the laundry, and there were two
initials marked on the hem. Show him the initials,
Pink.”</p>

<p>Ballard took the soiled handkerchief from his pocket,
ran the hem through his fingers, and then showed a section
of it to Darrel. The initials, “J.  L.,” were in plain
evidence.</p>

<p>“Well, strike me lucky!” muttered Darrel. “So it was
Jode! Still,” he added, “you wouldn’t call that evidence
conclusive, would you?”</p>

<p>“Mighty strong,” put in Ballard, “even if not conclusive.
But there’s other evidence, Darrel. Lenning
knew the combination of the safe and was in Gold Hill
on the night of the robbery. He said he wasn’t at the
house, but—well, maybe that was a lie.”</p>

<p>“Suppose,” remarked Merry, “Lenning was at the
house, and saw you there? That’s possible, isn’t it?
Then suppose that he hatched up this little scheme of
taking the money, after finding the knife you carelessly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_82">82</span>
left behind. There’s the colonel’s evidence against you—mighty
good evidence, and all manufactured!”</p>

<p>“Those are suppositions,” said Darrel, “and it’s evidence
in black and white that we ought to have, in a
matter of this kind.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” agreed Merry, “and that’s the reason we didn’t
show the handkerchief to the colonel, or spout any of
our theories. He’s all wrapped up in Lenning, and
wouldn’t believe anything against him.”</p>

<p>“There’s something else that makes me feel positive
that it was Lenning who brought the money into the
gulch last night,” said Ballard. “As the fellow came
along, Fritz and I heard a sort of tinkling sound like bits
of metal striking together. It was mighty faint, but we
heard it. Now, that fancy hat of Lenning’s, I noticed
yesterday, has bits of silver dangling from the brim, allee
same Mexicano. Don’t you think——”</p>

<p>“Pink,” cried Merry enthusiastically, “you’re a born
detective! By thunder, this last clew of yours is the
best of the lot. It was Lenning who worked that game
on Darrel, no two ways about it. Eh, Darrel?”</p>

<p>“Looks that way,” answered Darrel cautiously, “but
we can’t be sure. Jode may have learned that I had
come back, and possibly that scared him, so he tried to
do me up with that supposed robbery.”</p>

<p>“Why was he scared?” demanded Merriwell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_83">83</span> “It was
because he evolved the notion that you were back to
look into that forgery matter. And that wouldn’t scare
him unless he had had a finger in it. Jode Lenning is
our mark! We’ll keep after him until we clear you,
Darrel. While we’re getting the football squad in shape
here, we’ll do a little gum-shoe work on the side, and see
if we can’t give you a clear title to the colonel’s friendship.
How’s that?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what I can ever do to square things
with you fellows,” murmured Darrel, “but it was certainly
a lucky day for me when I found Ophirites, instead
of Gold Hillers, at Tinaja Wells!”</p>

<p>“Can that!” grunted Clancy. “You’re one of us, Darrel,
and, like the Musketeers, with Chip and his chums,
it’s ‘one for all, and all for one.’ And Darrel’s a chum,
eh, Chip?”</p>

<p>“Just as long as he wants to be,” answered Merriwell
heartily.</p>

<small>GERMANY VERSUS MEXICO.</small></h2>


<p>“I say, Chip! For the love of Mike come up on the
mesa! There’s something going on up there that would
give a cast-iron cat a conniption fit.”</p>

<p>It was afternoon in the camp at Tinaja Wells. All
the Ophir squad of football players had been taken up
Mohave Cañon by Handy, the captain, on a hike. Only
a camp guard consisting of Merriwell, Ballard, Clancy,
and their new chum, Ellis Darrel, had been left behind.
Fritz Gesundheit, the fat German cook, and Silva, the
Mexican packer and camp roustabout, had not gone up
the cañon, having nothing to do with the Ophir eleven,
but they had vanished from the flat soon after a dozen
lads, in running togs, had trotted out of sight. Professor
Phineas Borrodaile, whose duties as tutor for Merry
and his chums were over for the day, had gone off somewhere
on a geological excursion. Clancy also had strolled
off, but suddenly he reappeared in camp, his freckled
face red with suppressed mirth. He was scarcely able
to talk, but as he reeled around and gasped for breath
he managed to make his request for the others to go
back with him to the mesa.</p>

<p>Merriwell, Ballard, and Darrel jumped up from the
shade of the cottonwood where they had been sitting
and stared at the red-headed chap in amazement.
Clancy, unable to control himself, leaned weakly against
the trunk of the cottonwood and laughed until he
choked.</p>

<p>“What the mischief ails you, Clan?” demanded Merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_85">85</span></p>

<p>“Where’d you get the funny powder, anyhow?” inquired
Ballard.</p>

<p>“Pass the joke around, pard,” urged Darrel.</p>

<p>With a violent effort Clancy managed to smother
his hilarity.</p>

<p>“Carrots and Hot Tamale have got the athletic bug,”
explained Clancy, “and the stunts they’re doing on the
mesa would bring tears to a pair of glass eyes. One
is trying to make a better showing than the other, and,
if I’m any prophet, they’ll get to slugging before they’re
many minutes older.”</p>

<p>The campers had not only given Fritz the nickname of
“Carrots” but they had also dubbed Silva the “Hot
Tamale.”</p>

<p>“We don’t want those two fellows to get to hammering
each other,” Merriwell remarked. “Ever since Carrots
took the Mexican’s place as cook there’s been bad blood
between those two.”</p>

<p>“What would we do for our meals,” asked Ballard
anxiously, “if Hot Tamale put Carrots in the hospital?”</p>

<p>“You’re always thinking of the eats,” grinned Clancy.
“But never mind that, Pink. Come on up, all of you,
and see the circus. We’ll hide and watch ’em, and if
they get to using their fists, we can interfere.”</p>

<p>The lads started forthwith for the low bank of the
mesa, just back of the camp, hurrying along after the
excited Clancy.</p>

<p>“Fat Fritz must have another delusion,” observed Ballard.
“Yesterday it was buried treasure, and to-day it’s
athletics. But who’d ever have thought that Silva could
catch the athletic fever?”</p>

<p>“I thought he was too much of a mañana boy to catch
anything but the measles,” laughed Darrel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_86">86</span> “I’ll bet a
bunch of mazuma Hot Tamale is going in for athletics
just because he wants to beat out Carrots at the same
game.”</p>

<p>“That’s the only reason,” Merriwell answered. “One
of them can’t bear to see the other try anything without
trying it himself.”</p>

<p>Carefully the lads crept up the slope of the mesa and,
from behind a screen of rocks, looked out on the athletic
field. They took one long look and then doubled down
behind the bowlders to laugh.</p>

<p>Fritz and Silva had raided the camp equipment for
a couple of gymnasium suits. Probably they had not
been able to choose their costumes with discrimination,
but had been obliged to annex the first outfits that came
to hand. Yet, be that as it might, each presented a
picture that, to use Ballard’s words, would have made
“a horse laugh.”</p>

<p>The Dutch boy was too big around for his clothes
and too short the other way, while in Silva’s case the
matter was exactly the reverse: the running pants flapped
distressingly about his bony shanks, while the sleeveless
shirt failed to connect with the pants by a good six
inches.</p>

<p>Fritz was sweating and grunting and trying to do a
pole vault. The bar was about four feet from the
ground, and, from the looks of things, seemed some three
feet too high.</p>

<p>Silva was doing a Nautch dance in a seven-foot ring
and trying to throw a hammer. He would whirl around
a dozen times or so, and then, when he tried to let the
hammer fly, was so dizzy he fell on it.</p>

<p>With dismal regularity Fritz would knock his shins
against the bar, and Silva would stagger and fall. Sometimes
the vaulting pole would come down and crack the
Dutch boy on the head; and, as a general thing, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_87">87</span>
Mexican would forget to let go of the hammer, and
the wire would wrap around his body and the weight
would hit him in the small of the back. These accidents,
naturally, were hardly warranted to sweeten the
temper of the would-be athletes. Fritz was exploding
choppy remarks, and Silva was hissing maledictions in
liquid Spanish. Finally, the inevitable happened, and
during a period of rest the two began saying things
about each other.</p>

<p>Fritz, sitting on the ground and more or less tangled
up with the pole and the bar, looked over at Silva. The
latter had just thrown himself to his knees, and the
weight had drummed into his back with a thump that
had drawn Fritz’ attention.</p>

<p>“Vat you try to do mit yourselluf, you greaser lopster?”
shouted the scornful Fritz. “Dot veight iss for
drowing, und not for pounding yourselluf your ribs on.
You will not make an athletic feller in a t’ousant years.”</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Ay de mi!</i>” flung back Silva, through his teeth. “You
make big talk, but you not so much. I t’row de weight
before you jump de bar, dat is cinch. <i lang ="es-mx">Caramba!</i> You
one tub, one gringo rhi-rhi-no-cer-oos! <i lang ="es-mx">Si</i>, dat is all—rhi-rhi-no-cer-oos!”
Silva pushed out a hand and
pointed an insulting finger at Fritz. “Rhi-rhi-no-cer-oos!”
he repeated, in a burst of fury and contempt.</p>

<p>“By shiminy grickeds,” fumed Fritz, “no greaser feller
iss going to call me someding like dot! I take it your
hide oudt, py shinks!”</p>

<p>He floundered about on the ground until he had succeeded
in getting to his feet. Silva, scenting a resort
to fisticuffs in the Dutch boy’s move, likewise arose.
The two, separated by perhaps a dozen feet, stood glaring
at each other.</p>

<p>“Lopster!” taunted Fritz,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_88">88</span> “greaser lopster!”</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Gringo chingado!</i>” screeched Silva. “Rhi-rhi-no-cer-oos!”</p>

<p>Fritz picked up the bar and started toward the Mexican.
Somehow, the bar got between his fat legs and
he tripped himself and again went down. Silva, still
holding the hammer, made a defensive movement with
it, and the weight swung back against one of his knees.
With a howl of pain he dropped the hammer and fell
to rubbing his kneecap.</p>

<p>“I tell you vat I do, py shiminy Grismus!” wheezed
Fritz, once more getting erect and kicking the bar angrily
to one side. “I kick you mit der footpall. Der vone vat
kicks der pall farder as der oder feller iss der pest man,
hey?”</p>

<p>“I keek, or I fight, or I t’row de weight, or I jump,”
yelled Silva. “What I care, huh? I beat you at ever’t’ing.”</p>

<p>“Talk,” returned Fritz, “iss der cheapest ding vat iss.
Ve kick each odder mit der footpall, und I send him
sky-high und make you feel like t’irty cents. Fairst I
kick, den you. I peen der pest kicker vat efer habbened.
Vatch a leetle.”</p>

<p>Merry and his friends, behind the pile of rocks at the
edge of the mesa, had been enjoying themselves hugely.
They had thought, for a few moments, that the time
had come for them to interfere and stop a fight, and it
was with a good deal of satisfaction that they saw a
personal encounter give way to a kicking match.</p>

<p>“Great Scott!” exclaimed Merriwell, watching while
Fritz stepped to one side and picked up a football,
“they’ve got our best five-dollar pigskin. Those fellows
must be given to understand that they can’t tamper with
our football equipment.”</p>

<p>“See this out first, Chip,” pleaded Ballard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_89">89</span> “Don’t interfere
until the kicking match is over with. Look at
Fritz, will you. From the preparations he’s making
you’d think he was going to kick the ball clear into
the middle of next week.”</p>

<p>Very carefully Fritz was heaping up a little pile of
sand; then, still with the same elaborate care, he stood
the ball on this mound, drew back, and swung his foot.
Once, twice, the foot went back and forth; the third
time, Fritz nerved himself for a supreme attempt. One
would have thought he was making ready to kick in the
side of a house. Forward flew the foot, missed the ball
altogether, and the kicker came down on his back.</p>

<p>A cackle of insulting laughter came from the Mexican.
“Rhi-rhi-no-cer-oos!” he taunted. “Dat is not de
way I make de keek. Watch, and you see.”</p>

<p>With that Silva ran at the ball and lifted it high and
far. No doubt it was an accident, but it made Fritz
green with envy.</p>

<p>“I can do petter as dot!” he shouted. “Vait, now,
vile I haf some shances mit it!”</p>

<p>Silva, however, wouldn’t wait. Fired with his initial
success, he ran after the ball and lifted it again before
Fritz could come near enough to kick. The ardor of the
Mexican took him and the ball off the mesa and southward
along the high, steep wall of the cañon, below
Tinaja Wells. Fritz was in hot pursuit, and Frank and
his chums came out from behind the bowlders and hurried
along after the Dutch boy in order to see the outcome
of the one-sided “match.”</p>

<p>Silva, the bounding ball, and Fritz were lost in the
rough country adjacent to the cañon’s brink; and when
the trailers had come up with the Dutchman and the
Mexican they found the two locked in a deadly struggle.</p>

<p>Silva, it seems, had kicked the ball into the cañon, and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_90">90</span>
while he was peering over the rim looking for it, fat
Fritz had overhauled him and, in his wrath, had gone
for him hammer and tongs.</p>

<p>While Merriwell, Ballard, and Darrel were separating
the combatants, Clancy was kneeling on the rim rock and
peering downward in an attempt to locate the ball. Suddenly
he got up and whirled around.</p>

<p>“Here’s a go!” he exclaimed. “A five-dollar ball has
gone to blazes, Chip. It’s about thirty feet down a
sheer wall, on a bit of a shelf. We’ll have to sprout
wings before we ever get hold of that ball again. You’ll
have to dock Carrots’ and Hot Tamale’s wages for the
price of it.”</p>

<p>A howl of protest went up from Fritz and Silva.</p>

<small>AN UNEXPECTED VISITOR.</small></h2>


<p>“Keep these scrappers apart, Pink, you and Darrel,”
said Merry, moving over to Clancy’s side. “If that ball
is only thirty feet away, Clan,” he added to his red-headed
chum, “we’ll be able to get it, all right.”</p>

<p>“I don’d pay for nodding,” puffed the enraged Fritz.
“Dot greaser feller kicked him ofer, und you vill take der
money oudt oof der pay vat comes py him.”</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Diablo!</i>” snapped Silva. “Dat Dutchmans get de ball
from de camp—I no get him. Take dat dinero out of me,
and I quit <i lang ="es-mx">muy pronto</i>.”</p>

<p>“You peen some pad eggs,” wheezed Fritz, “und I
preak your face in!”</p>

<p>“Yah, yah, yah!” taunted the Mexican. “You not able
to break de face in.”</p>

<p>Ballard and Darrel, enjoying the situation more than
they cared to show before Fritz and Silva, clung to the
two would-be sluggers and held them apart. Merriwell,
on his knees at the rim of the cañon, turned to look
around at the Dutch boy and the Mexican.</p>

<p>“Cut out this fighting,” said he sternly. “The one that
strikes the first blow will have the five dollars taken
out of his pay. Keep hands off of each other and neither
of you will have to pay a cent if the ball is lost. Understand
that, Fritz? And you, Silva?”</p>

<p>The warlike ardor of the two was appreciably lessened.
Fritz ceased his floundering struggles to get at the Mexican,
and Silva suddenly grew docile. Merry’s threat was
a master stroke.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_92">92</span></p>

<p>“Let them go, fellows,” went on Merry, smothering
a desire to laugh. “You and Silva go back to camp,
Fritz, and if you’re not peaceable, just remember that
your pay will be docked. And hereafter leave our
athletic equipment alone. I don’t object to your doing
a little training—in fact, I think it would be a good thing
for each of you—but when you go at it again you’d better
have an instructor. I’ll be glad to put you through
a course of sprouts any time you feel the need of it.”</p>

<p>Without indulging in any remarks, Fritz and Silva
started off in the direction of the mesa and the camp.
They did not travel in company but straggled along at
a distance from each other. As soon as they were out
of sight, Ballard turned around with a laugh.</p>

<p>“That five-dollar play of yours, Chip,” said he, “was
a winner. Fritz is a tightwad, and Silva pinches a dollar
till he makes the eagle squeal. They’ll be peaceable
for a while, take it from me.”</p>

<p>“How about the ball, Chip?” inquired Darrel, hastening
to join the two on the edge of the cañon wall.</p>

<p>“There it is,” Merry answered, pointing downward.</p>

<p>The wall was a sheer drop, and the ball could be
seen lying on a narrow shelf at least thirty feet below.
A small bowlder lay near the edge of the shelf, and the
oval had been caught between that and the clifflike wall
from which the shelf projected. Below the shelf was
another fall of thirty or forty feet to the bottom of the
cañon.</p>

<p>“How the mischief do you suppose the ball happened
to lodge there?” inquired Clancy. “If it had been kicked
over the cliff, I should think it would have fallen too
far out to hit the shelf.”</p>

<p>“Probably,” Merriwell suggested,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_93">93</span> “it just rolled over
the rim and dropped straight down. Anyhow, there it
is, and it’s up to us to get it.”</p>

<p>Darrel straightened on his knees and looked around
him at the lay of the land adjacent to the brink.</p>

<p>“It’s easy enough to get the ball, fellows,” said he.
“There’s a paloverde, just back of us, growing in the
edge of that clump of greasewood. We can splice a
couple of reatas, hitch one end to the paloverde, and I
can shin down and be back with the ball in no time.”</p>

<p>“Where’ll we get the reatas?” returned Clancy. “I’ve
got one, but it’s a scant thirty feet long. Fritz—darn
him!—cut off a piece of it the other day to use for something
or other.”</p>

<p>“As far as that goes,” put in Merry, “I guess we could
pick up an extra piece of rope around the camp. But
maybe we won’t have to try this reata business. Get
some sticks and let’s see if we can’t dislodge the ball and
knock it into the bottom of the cañon.”</p>

<p>They gathered pieces of dried timber and rained them
down on the shelf. Several clubs reached the ball, but
the bowlder held it firmly.</p>

<p>“No earthly use,” said Ballard. “The pigskin is
wedged there as though it was in a vise.”</p>

<p>“Thou art so near, and yet so far!” hummed Clancy,
staring down at the ball. “I wonder,” he continued, “if
we couldn’t come up from below? The cliff doesn’t seem
so steep under the shelf.”</p>

<p>“I was thinking of that, Clan,” Merry answered.</p>

<p>“It won’t take me more than half an hour to scare
up that reata and an extra piece of rope,” said Darrel.
“I reckon the spliced ropes are our best bet, Chip.”</p>

<p>Merry had been taking stock of the cliff face above
the shelf. Wind and weather had worn it smooth and
slippery, and there was not a projection in the whole<span class="pagenum" id="Page_94">94</span>
thirty feet from the brink to the shelf which a climber
could use in getting back to the top of the wall.</p>

<p>“Strikes me,” said Merry, “it’s a difficult job, not to
say dangerous. How are you on the climb, Darrel?”</p>

<p>“Well,” he admitted, “I can throw a rope a heap better
than I can climb one, but I’ll gamble my spurs I can
come over that thirty feet of wall without much trouble.”</p>

<p>“It’s as smooth as glass,” remarked Ballard. “All your
weight would be on your arms from the moment you
left the shelf—you couldn’t use your feet at all.”</p>

<p>“My arms would stand it.”</p>

<p>“Suppose you had the ball under one arm, Curly?”
Clancy queried.</p>

<p>“What’s the matter with kicking the ball into the
cañon?” returned Darrel. “I wouldn’t have to tote it
back.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, too,” said Clancy.</p>

<p>“Before we try the rope trick, Darrel,” spoke up Merry,
rising to his feet, “we’ll go back to camp; come down the
cañon and see if the wall under the shelf can’t be scaled.”</p>

<p>“It can’t,” asserted Darrel, with conviction. “I can
see enough of it from here to make me sure of that.”</p>

<p>“We’ll look over the ground from below, anyhow,”
said Merriwell. “Come on, fellows; there’s no use hanging
around here.”</p>

<p>“Wait a minute, Chip,” called Ballard, who was still
standing at the cañon’s brink. “There’s a man on a horse
coming up the gulch. Wonder if he’s bound for Tinaja
Wells? I wouldn’t swear to it, but I’ve a notion the rider
is Colonel Hawtrey.”</p>

<p>At this Darrel whirled with a muttered exclamation and
peered down at the white streak of trail angling back
and forth among the trees and masses of bowlders. The
horseman was proceeding slowly northward, his head<span class="pagenum" id="Page_95">95</span>
bowed in deep thought. In a few moments he would be
abreast of the lads on the top of the wall, and almost
under the shelf.</p>

<p>“It <em>is</em> the colonel!” muttered Darrel, in an odd, strained
voice. “Why do you suppose he’s riding this way? I’ll
take my solemn Alfred he’s bound for our camp.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be too sure of it, old man,” said Merriwell.
“He pulled out with the Gold Hillers early this morning
to see them safely settled in a camp of their own.
That bunch went south, didn’t they? Well, it stands to
reason that the colonel has to come this way in order to
get back to Gold Hill.”</p>

<p>“No, Chip,” disagreed Darrel, “the colonel’s easiest
course to Gold Hill from below Tinaja Wells would be
by the other trail from Dolliver’s. He’s got business at
our camp, and that’s the reason he’s coming this way.
Maybe,” and Darrel’s face filled with foreboding, “what
he’s got in mind has something to do with me.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a taking about it, Darrel,” Merriwell
answered, laying a hand on his new chum’s shoulder.
“It’s a cinch that anything the colonel may have in his
mind can’t hurt you. If he’s going to be a visitor, we’d
better go down and see what he wants.”</p>

<p>Without delaying further, the boys started on their
return to camp. In spite of Merriwell’s reassuring
words, however, the troubled look did not leave Darrel’s
face.</p>

<small>TRUE SPORTSMANSHIP.</small></h2>


<p>When Merriwell and his friends reached the flat they
found Colonel Hawtrey sitting on a bench under a cottonwood.
His horse, with reins hanging from the bit
rings, stood a little way off. It was evident that the
colonel intended making his visit brief.</p>

<p>As the boys approached, the colonel arose from the
bench. His eyes met Darrel’s for a moment, and then
swerved abruptly to Merriwell.</p>

<p>“I’d like a few words with you, Merriwell,” said he.</p>

<p>“Can’t you stay with us for a while, colonel?” Merry
inquired. “We’d be delighted to have you take supper
and——”</p>

<p>“I thank you for the invitation,” he broke in, “but I
must be back in Gold Hill to-night. I came the cañon
trail purposely to speak with you.”</p>

<p>The others withdrew, Darrel with a lingering look of
apprehension at Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Sit down here,” invited the colonel, resuming his place
on the bench. “You don’t smoke, of course,” he went
on, taking a cigar from his pocket when he and Frank
were seated, “for, if you did, you wouldn’t be following
the footsteps of your father before you.” He
scratched a match thoughtfully and applied it to the
tip of the cigar. “‘Chip,’ they call you, eh?” he proceeded
presently, with the hint of a smile under his gray
mustache. “I suppose that means that you’re a ‘chip of
the old block’?”</p>

<p>“That’s where the nickname comes from, colonel,”
young Merriwell answered, with a laugh.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_97">97</span></p>

<p>“I don’t know your father personally,” said the
colonel, with some enthusiasm, “but I have seen him on
several occasions, both in the East and at his T Bar
Ranch in Wyoming. I have also heard a great deal
about him. I reckon he typifies everything a man can
express in the term true sportsmanship.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, colonel,” answered Frank. “Dad is all
you think him—and more.”</p>

<p>“If you’re a chip of the old block, you ought to
stand for all that your father stands for.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said the puzzled youngster, “as well as
I can.”</p>

<p>“Well,” continued Colonel Hawtrey, “I’ve stopped here
this afternoon to appeal to you as a true sportsman, and
as a son of the Frank Merriwell I have seen a few times
and of whom I have heard so much.”</p>

<p>He paused. Frank was already over his head wondering
what the colonel was trying to get at. He said nothing,
but waited respectfully for the other to broach the
subject he had in mind.</p>

<p>“As you doubtless know,” remarked the colonel, “I
founded the Gold Hill Athletic Club, and have been its
best patron during the few years it has been in existence.
Some people say”—and he smiled slightly—“that
I am cracked on the subject of athletics. It’s a hobby
with me, for I believe that, rightly directed, sports of the
track and field do more to develop properly a young
man’s character than anything else in the world. On the
other hand, if wrongly directed they are a source of much
harm. Just at the present time, and much as I regret
to say it, the club at Ophir and the one at Gold Hill
are heading in the wrong direction.</p>

<p>“A bitter partisan spirit has crept into the competitions
between the two clubs. Some of the members—I wo<span class="pagenum" id="Page_98">98</span>n’t
say all of them—have proved that they are not good
losers. Rancor has shown its ugly head, Merriwell. I
think that you, more than any one else, can help to foster
a different spirit between the clubs.”</p>

<p>Frank tried to speak, but the colonel lifted his hand.</p>

<p>“Just a moment, my lad,” said he. “I want to place
the whole matter frankly before you, and then get your
sentiments regarding it. You don’t belong in Ophir any
more than you do in Gold Hill. As I understand it, you
are in Ophir only temporarily, and Bradlaugh, president
of the Ophir club, got you to coach the Ophir eleven for
the coming Thanksgiving Day game with Gold Hill. This
is all right, and Bradlaugh is to be congratulated. I believe
that you will give Ophir a good team, perhaps a
winning team. In the interests of true sport I wish
you every success. For the past two years Gold Hill
has had nearly everything its own way—too much so,
for sharp competition is the life of athletic sports; it’s
the only thing that brings out the best that is in us.</p>

<p>“I have heard, with much regret, that there was almost
a clash between the two clubs when Gold Hill, by mistake,
came here to claim this camping site. This is all
wrong, and not at all as it should be. Sport is bound to
suffer if the hard feeling is not done away with.</p>

<p>“Now, you have befriended Ellis Darrel. So far, Merriwell,
it has been commendable in you to take his part
as you have done. I am hoping that your friendship will
do much for the boy. Although personally I am done
with him, yet I cannot forget that he is my sister’s son.
I confess an interest in him on that account. But I wish
to warn you against letting Darrel prejudice you against
his half brother, Jode Lenning. Jode is a dutiful nephew
in every way, and, above and beyond that, he is a true
sportsman.” The colonel paused, then added impres<span class="pagenum" id="Page_99">99</span>sively:
“I know Jode better than any one else, and I assure
you that what I say is true. I am an old man,
Merriwell, and I have been for years in the military
service of my country. I want you to believe that my
judgment is sound, and I want you to accept Jode as I
know him, and not as Darrel may offer him to you.”</p>

<p>“Colonel,” said Merry, “Ellis Darrel has said nothing
against his half brother that would cause me to take a
different estimate of him than you wish me to have.”</p>

<p>“Then I am to presume that your estimate is favorable?
If anything is done to wipe out the bitterness between
the two clubs, there is the point where the work must
begin.”</p>

<p>Merriwell’s estimate of Jode Lenning was a good way
from being favorable. The sly trick by which Lenning
had tried to get possession of the camping ground at
Tinaja Wells was well known to Merry and to all the
Ophir fellows. Had not the colonel been so completely
dominated by Lenning’s influence, he would have seen
and recognized that trick himself. Furthermore, it was
Merry’s settled conviction that Lenning had tried to
involve Darrel in that theft of the thousand dollars; and
Merry had a belief that, when the bottom of the forgery
affair was reached, Lenning would be found to have had
a hand in that.</p>

<p>But what good would it have done to tell all this to
Colonel Hawtrey? He would merely have thought that
Frank had been influenced by Darrel against Lenning.
Besides, Frank had no proof in black and white connecting
Lenning with the robbery, and only a suspicion of
him in the matter of the forgery.</p>

<p>“I have tried to do what I could to patch up the differences
between Ophir and Gold Hill, colonel,” said
Frank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_100">100</span> “and I’m willing to keep on trying. I believe I
can promise that the Ophir fellows will show the right
spirit, if you and Lenning can induce the Gold Hill
club to meet them halfway.”</p>

<p>“Ah,” exclaimed the colonel, with deep satisfaction,
“there you have it! Now we’re getting together in the
right sort of style. My lads have found a most excellent
camp in a gulch leading off Mohave Cañon, below here.
They have a mile of deep water which serves admirably
for water sports, and all they lack is a mesa like yours
for an athletic field. Some of them are now clearing
brush from a patch of desert for their football practice.
Now,” and the colonel gave a winning smile, “why can’t
the Ophirites and the Gold Hillers be neighborly? Why
can’t you visit back and forth and have pleasant little
contests of one kind and another? That need not interfere
very much with your football work, and ought
to afford an agreeable change in the monotony of camp
life. It’s about eight miles to Camp Hawtrey, as the boys
call their place, if you go through the cañon and the
gulch, but across country it’s hardly more than half that.
How does the proposition strike you, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“First-rate,” Frank answered. “We Ophir fellows
wouldn’t like anything better. That stretch of water,
over at Camp Hawtrey, would be a fine place for boat
races—and we haven’t any such layout here.”</p>

<p>“Exactly!” beamed the colonel.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_101">101</span> “I should be delighted
to come out from town and see some of your contests.
A friendly rivalry, Merriwell, will go far toward inculcating
a different spirit between the clubs. Eh? I’m
more than obliged to you for meeting my advances in the
matter so agreeably. Jode is coming over here this afternoon
to get an expression from you relative to a football
game for to-morrow, or next day. What are the
prospects?”</p>

<p>“Good, I should say,” said Frank. “I’ll broach the
matter to Handy as soon as he gets back from up the
cañon.”</p>

<p>“That’s the talk!” cried the colonel enthusiastically.</p>

<p>Merriwell was more than pleased with Colonel
Hawtrey’s suggestion for a series of competitions between
the two camps. Incidentally, if the contests were
conducted in the right spirit, they would go far toward
healing old wounds. Mainly, however, Merriwell wanted
to come into closer contact with Jode Lenning, and see
what he could discover, if anything, that would prove a
benefit to Ellis Darrel. These proposed contests could
not but help him in this desire.</p>

<p>The colonel, having achieved the purpose that brought
him to Tinaja Wells, got up from the bench in high,
good humor.</p>

<p>“You are really a chip of the old block, Merriwell,”
he laughed, “and it’s something for you to be proud of.”</p>

<p>Merry thought he might take advantage of the colonel’s
amiable nature at that moment and do a little something
for his new chum.</p>

<p>“Have you any word to leave for Ellis Darrel, colonel?”
he asked.</p>

<p>The good humor left the other’s face. He straightened
his shoulders stiffly and his eyes narrowed under a black
frown.</p>

<p>“The one word I have for Darrel,” said he harshly,
“is this: that he keep away from me. If he’s got it in
him, he’ll live down the past; if he hasn’t, he’ll go to
the dogs. I shall be glad to learn that he’s making something
of himself, but—but I never want to see him
again.”</p>

<p>There was sadness in the colonel’s voice as he spoke,
but sternness and determination were there, as well.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_102">102</span>
Frank’s heart grew heavy as he watched the colonel pull
the reins over the head of his horse and swing up into
the saddle.</p>

<p>“Good-by, Merriwell,” he called, waving his hat as he
rode off the flat and headed northward along the cañon
trail.</p>

<p>“Lenning has the old boy right under his thumb,”
Merriwell muttered, as he turned away.</p>

<p>Ballard, Clancy, and Darrel had disappeared. Merry
asked Fritz about them, and was told that Ballard and
Clancy had gone down the cañon to see if they couldn’t
get up to the shelf and recover the football; but where
Darrel was, Fritz did not know.</p>

<p>“He’s probably with Ballard and Clancy,” said Frank.
“Keep away from Silva, Fritz, if you don’t want to get
fined!”</p>

<p>“Dot greaser feller,” answered Fritz scornfully, “ain’d
vort’ fife cents, say nodding aboudt fife tollar. You bed
my life I leaf him alone.”</p>

<p>Frank, hastily leaving the camp, made his way down the
cañon to do what he could to help recover the lost football.</p>

<small>A TERRIBLE MISHAP.</small></h2>


<p>Merriwell found Ballard and Clancy surveying the cliff
from a spot almost under the shelf where the football had
lodged. That they were extremely dubious about recovering
it from below was evident from their actions.</p>

<p>“Here’s Chip, Pink,” said Clancy; “perhaps his eagle
eye can pick out a trail up the side of that wall.”</p>

<p>“If it can,” returned Ballard, “Chip’s entitled to a
leather medal.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Darrel, fellows?” was Merriwell’s first question
when he reached the side of his chums.</p>

<p>“Search me,” answered Clancy, in some surprise. “He
was back there on the flat when Pink and I left.”</p>

<p>“Probably he ducked into one of the tents,” said Ballard.
“The look Hawtrey gave him, there under the cottonwood,
was enough to make almost anybody squirm
away and get out of sight. Holy smoke, but that colonel’s
a cold-blooded proposition!”</p>

<p>“Darn shame, too, the way he hands it to Darrel,”
growled Clancy. “Jode Lenning’s a skunk—any one can
see that with half an eye—yet here the old colonel coddles
up to Lenning and throws a frost into Darrel every time
he gets the chance. Hawtrey must be dippy. What was
the chin-chin all about, Chip?”</p>

<p>Merriwell repeated the gist of the colonel’s remarks.</p>

<p>“Listen to that!” exclaimed Clancy. “So he thinks
Lenning is a true sportsman, does he? How do you suppose
Lenning manages to pull the wool over his eyes?”</p>

<p>“Because he’s slick, and hasn’t any scruples to amount
to anything,” said Ballard;<span class="pagenum" id="Page_104">104</span> “that’s how.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think we ought to have anything to do with
Lenning and that bunch of his, Chip,” declared the red-headed
boy wrathfully. “Because Lenning has the colonel
landed and strung, that’s no sign we should let him
repeat the operation with us.”</p>

<p>“Why, you old lobster,” said Merry, with a laugh, “the
landing and stringing is to be the other way around. How
are we going to help Darrel unless we can get close to
Lenning? Don’t be so thick, Clan. No matter what our
convictions are, can’t you see that we haven’t an atom of
proof against Lenning? It’s easy enough to call him a
skunk, but the next thing is to prove it.”</p>

<p>“Chip’s right,” said Ballard, “we’ve got to get the
goods on Lenning. That’s the only way we can help
Darrel. And how are we to get the goods on him if
we don’t have anything to do with him or the Gold
Hillers? If we have a series of contests with that rival
camp, it will give us a tiptop chance to find out a few
things about Lenning.”</p>

<p>“Sure thing,” said Frank. “Furthermore, if we take
up these contests in the right spirit, there’s no reason
on earth why Ophir and Gold Hill can’t come to be
friends as well as rivals.”</p>

<p>“But the colonel is off his trolley about one thing, Chip,”
put in Clancy, “and that is that Lenning is a power for
peace on the other side. Simmer the business right down,
and I’ll bet you find that Lenning is the biggest trouble
maker in the Gold Hill crowd.”</p>

<p>“I think so myself, Clan,” said Merry, “but I haven’t
any cold facts to prove it. Let’s get the facts, and then
we can talk to some purpose.”</p>

<p>“That’s the idea!” agreed Ballard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_105">105</span> “I’m glad we’re
going to have a little preliminary try-out with Gold Hill
on the gridiron. We’ll be able to see just how good they
are, and can go after some of their weak points.”</p>

<p>Merriwell grinned.</p>

<p>“Strikes me, Pink,” said he, “that they’re thinking exactly
the same thing about us. But we’d better cut out
this powwow and see what we can do to get our hands on
that ball.”</p>

<p>Merry drew back and passed a swift, keen glance over
the face of the cañon wall. What he saw was not at all
reassuring. There were a number of projections, below
that upper shelf where the ball had lodged, but at its
base the cliff sloped inward instead of outward. To
scale the lower twenty feet of wall a fellow would have
to cling to the rocks, like a fly to the ceiling.</p>

<p>“We could use wings to better advantage from down
here, Chip,” observed Clancy, “than from the top of
the cliff.”</p>

<p>“If a fellow could get over that first stretch of twenty
or twenty-five feet,” mused Merriwell, studying the wall,
“he would have tolerably clear sailing from that point
to the top shelf. There are plenty of bushes and projections
to help in the climbing, and the wall has a bit
of a slope in the right direction. By Jove!” he suddenly
exclaimed, “I believe I see a way to make it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t take any chances, Chip,” urged Ballard anxiously.
“The foot of the wall is covered with stones,
and it would be a bad place to take a drop.”</p>

<p>“It would be a drop too much,” punned Clancy, “and
you know what that does to a fellow, Chip.”</p>

<p>“I don’t intend to take a drop,” answered Merriwell,
walking down the cañon for about twenty feet and then
turning directly toward the cliff.</p>

<p>At that point the inward slope of the wall was not so
pronounced, and there was a fissure, with a projecting<span class="pagenum" id="Page_106">106</span>
lower lip, angling across the face of the rocks, its upper
end clearing the bad bit of wall under the shelf which it
was necessary to gain.</p>

<p>“Going to try to climb up that crack, Chip?” yelled
Ballard.</p>

<p>“Why not?” was the cool response. “It leads to a
place where climbing is easy.”</p>

<p>“Stop it!” whooped Ballard. “You’re crazy to think of
such a thing! You’ll tumble off the rocks just as sure as
the world.”</p>

<p>“Come on back, Chip!” called Clancy. “The pesky old
ball isn’t worth it.”</p>

<p>“Keep your shirts on, both of you,” was the calmly
confident reply. “I’m not such a fool as to risk my neck
for a five-dollar ball.”</p>

<p>Nevertheless, to Ballard and Clancy that seemed exactly
what Merriwell was about to do. They watched
him, almost holding their breath.</p>

<p>With a little spring, Merriwell landed on the lower edge
of the fissure. Less than three feet above him was the
overhang. This overhang came close to the shelf below
at a distance of four yards upward in its oblique course,
and at that place the lower lip of the fissure began to jut
out and afford a foothold.</p>

<p>Slowly, digging into crevices with his toes and reaching
for others with his hands, Frank began traversing the
crack in the wall. Once his foot slipped, and both lads
who were watching gave vent to a yell of fright.</p>

<p>“My nerves are all shot to pieces, Chip,” shouted
Clancy. “Next time you do a thing like that I’ll throw
a fit.”</p>

<p>Frank clung to his place and turned to look smilingly
down at his chums.</p>

<p>“Rot!” said he.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_107">107</span> “Why, fellows, this is as easy as pie.”</p>

<p>He climbed on, crouching lower and lower as the overhang
descended toward the shelf below. Presently he
was in the narrowest part, hanging to the steep slope of
the lower lip of the crevice and compelled to drop on
all fours in order to keep inside of it.</p>

<p>“You can’t make yourself thin enough to get through
it,” shouted Ballard discouragingly. “Ten feet farther
up, Chip, the crack isn’t wide enough for a chipmunk.”</p>

<p>“It looks a whole lot harder from down there,” Frank
called back, “than it does from here. When I get to
that narrow place, I’ll step out and walk around it.”</p>

<p>“Yes, you will! You’ll play the deuce trying that. I
think——”</p>

<p>What Ballard thought did not appear. Just at that
moment, he and Clancy heard a swishing sound which attracted
their eyes to the wall above the shelf. Exclamations
of astonishment escaped them. A rope had dropped
its length downward from above, and there, on the very
crest of the cliff, the rope in his hands, sat Darrel!</p>

<p>“What’s going on down there, pards?” yelled Darrel.</p>

<p>“Chip’s trying to break his neck walking a rock tight
rope,” Clancy answered, making a trumpet of his hands.</p>

<p>“This is my job,” whooped Darrel, “and I don’t think
it’s fair for Chip to cut me out of it. Tell him to come
down. In about two shakes I’ll be kicking the ball off
the shelf and right into your hands.”</p>

<p>“Is that Darrel up there?” Frank asked.</p>

<p>“Sure it’s Darrel, Chip,” replied Ballard. “He’s got
a rope hitched to the paloverde, and is all ready to come
down.”</p>

<p>“Tell him I can get the ball easier than he can, and
for him to pull up the rope and give me a chance at it.”</p>

<p>Darrel heard the words, and did not put those below
to the trouble of repeating them.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_108">108</span></p>

<p>“No, you don’t, Chip!” he shouted. “If you’re climbing
up to the shelf, go back down to the foot of the
wall. I’ll have the ball before you can come anywhere
near it.”</p>

<p>There was finality in Darrel’s voice, and Frank knew
it was useless to argue with him.</p>

<p>“Wait!” he cried. “Don’t slide down, Darrel, until
I get to the bottom of the wall. Will you wait?”</p>

<p>“Sure I’ll wait. I’ll give you all the chance you want
to see the performance.”</p>

<p>Frank went down the fissure much faster than he had
climbed up, and without a mishap of any kind had soon
regained the bottom of the cañon. Making his way to
where Ballard and Clancy were standing, he turned his
eyes upward. Darrel waved his hat to him.</p>

<p>“So that’s what you were up to, eh?” called Frank.
“Why didn’t you tell us what you were about and we
could have helped you get the ropes.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think you would,” came the laughing reply
from Darrel. “You thought the work was too dangerous.
Here I come!”</p>

<p>He swung half around, preparatory to lowering himself.</p>

<p>“Better wait until a couple of us come up there, Darrel!”
Frank called.</p>

<p>“Don’t need anybody. You can’t see the paloverde,
as it’s screened by the greasewood, but you can gamble
that I tied the rope good and hard. Now, watch!”</p>

<p>Thereupon Darrel lowered himself down and was presently
swinging against the smooth wall. He was agile
enough, and twisted one leg around the dangling rope
and slid slowly toward the shelf. Then, when he was
some ten feet above the shelf, a most horrifying thing
happened. Before he could cry out, or make any move<span class="pagenum" id="Page_109">109</span>
to save himself if that had been possible, he dropped like
a stone to the ledge, struck heavily upon his side, lengthwise
of his body, rolled off limply, fell sprawling to a jutting
bowlder four or five feet below and lay there, silent
and motionless. A scraggly tree, growing from a crevice
among the stones, was all that held him from dropping
to the foot of the cliff!</p>

<p>The rope, strangely separated at the loop which had
coiled around the paloverde, fell writhing through the
air, pulled itself out of Darrell’s nerveless hand, and
dropped at the feet of the three horror-stricken lads
below.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XVII" id="CHAPTER_XVII">CHAPTER XVII.</a><br />

<small>A DARING RESCUE.</small></h2>


<p>A yell of consternation broke from Clancy’s lips. Merriwell
and Ballard were silent. With white, drawn faces
and wide, staring eyes, all three of the boys stood as
though rooted to the ground.</p>

<p>The accident had happened so suddenly that those below
were stunned. It took them a few moments to realize
the awful thing that had occurred. Frank was the first
to break the thrall of inaction that bound them.</p>

<p>“He can’t be badly hurt, fellows!” he called. “It wasn’t
much of a fall—about ten feet to the ledge and four or
five feet from the ledge to the bowlder. He’s stunned,
that’s all, but worse things are likely to happen if we don’t
get him down before he begins to revive.”</p>

<p>“How in thunder did the rope break away from the
paloverde?” cried Ballard. “Darrel said he was careful
to tie it securely, and——”</p>

<p>“Never mind that now, Pink,” Merriwell interrupted.
“As long as Darrel’s unconscious he won’t make a move,
but when he begins to come to himself, he’s liable to
stir around. If he does that, he’s going off that bowlder,
sure!”</p>

<p>Certainly it was a gruesome situation for Darrel. His
body hung over the projecting bowlder, face downward,
and only the tree’s twisted and stunted trunk, rising at
the bowlder’s edge, kept him from falling to the bottom of
the wall. It was a precarious support at best, however,
and the slightest move on Darrel’s part would dislodge
him in spite of the tree.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_111">111</span></p>

<p>“Get him down?” breathed Ballard. “How the blazes
can we do that, Chip? The best way is to get more
ropes and go down to him from the paloverde.”</p>

<p>“It would take too long.” Frank, his mind working
swiftly, had picked up the end of the spliced rope and
was making it fast around his waist. “I’m going up after
him,” he finished briefly, and started for the lower end
of the fissure.</p>

<p>If Ballard and Clancy had watched Merriwell with
bated breath before, when only the recovery of a five-dollar
football was to be the result of his dangerous
climb, how much greater was their trepidation now, when
the life of a chum was at stake?</p>

<p>The worst feature of the nerve-racking situation for
Ballard and Clancy was this, that they were absolutely
powerless to help Merriwell. No more than one could
make the climb through the fissure, and no more than
one could work around the jutting bowlder and the
stunted tree. For the lads in the bottom of the cañon,
a little active work would have loosened the tension of
their taut nerves and made the situation more endurable.
There was nothing for them to do just then, however, but
to wait and watch.</p>

<p>The swiftness and precision with which Frank scaled
the fissure aroused the admiration of his chums, even
in that breathless moment. Frank’s brain was as cool
and his nerves as steady as though life or death was not
hanging on the result of his efforts.</p>

<p>“Good old Merry!” whispered Ballard huskily. “He’s
going as steady as a clock, and doesn’t seem to have the
least notion that Darrel may tumble down on him at any
moment.”</p>

<p>“Talk about your true sportsmen,” returned Clancy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_112">112</span> “if
a piece of work like that doesn’t prove a fellow is one,
then I don’t know what does.”</p>

<p>With the rope trailing after him and gradually paying
out from the coil below as he climbed higher and higher,
Merriwell continued his rapid ascent of the crevice.
On reaching the narrow part, he shifted around it with
an agility and skill that were wonderful to see. Getting
back into the fissure again, at a point where it widened,
he made his way on hands and knees to the place directly
over the point where the wall sloped inward to the base,
and began another inward slope to the shelf.</p>

<p>Getting out of the crevice and upon the slope was a
hair-raising performance, but Frank accomplished it successfully.
Then began the crawl from projection to projection
and from one stunted bush to another, up the face
of the cliff. At last the daring youth was directly under
the bowlder and the stunted tree that supported the unconscious
form of Darrel. With his left arm over the
bowlder and his feet in crevices of the rocks, Frank began
removing the rope from his waist with his right hand.</p>

<p>“Good work, Chip!” shouted Ballard. “What are you
going to do now? How do you expect to get Darrel
down? Can’t we do something to help?”</p>

<p>“Nothing you fellows can do, Ballard,” Frank answered.
“I’ve got to hang on with my eye winkers and
work with one hand.”</p>

<p>“If Darrel should make a move,” cried Clancy, in a
spasm of fear, “he’d bring you both down!”</p>

<p>“I’ll have the rope around him before he moves,” was
the reply.</p>

<p>Working with one hand, as Frank was obliged to do,
it was a difficult task to manage the rope. If the cable
were dropped, all Frank’s work would have gone for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_113">113</span>
nothing, and before he could do it over again Darrel
would probably revive and slip from the bowlder.</p>

<p>First, Frank passed the rope around the trunk of the
stunted tree. A brief examination of the tree had convinced
him that it was strongly wedged into the rocks
and could be depended upon to support Darrel’s weight.</p>

<p>In getting the hempen strands around the tree, Frank
was obliged to push the rope over the trunk, then hold
it in his teeth while he withdrew his hand and passed
it around the trunk a second time. Again taking the
cable in his teeth, he withdrew his hand to lay hold of
it once more. Thus he had made a half hitch around the
tree and could control the rope under the pull of a heavy
weight.</p>

<p>His next step was to make the end of the cable fast
about Darrel’s shoulders, under the arms. This was not
so difficult as the work with the tree had been, for Darrel
hung from the bowlder with head and shoulders down.</p>

<p>After getting the cable about Darrel’s body, Frank
used his right hand and his teeth and rove the end into
a bowline knot. Scarcely had he accomplished this, when
Darrel uttered a low groan and attempted to shift his
position. The moment he did this, he slipped from the
bowlder.</p>

<p>A yell of horror came from Ballard and Clancy. To
their frightened eyes it looked as though both Darrel
and Merriwell would be precipitated to the bottom of the
cañon. The rope, however, and Frank’s quickness served
to avert the catastrophe.</p>

<p>Releasing his left arm from the bowlder, Frank gripped
the trailing rope under the tree with both hands. His
weight, on one side of the dwarfed trunk, served to balance
Darrel’s weight on the other side, and the two, for
a few terrible moments, swung into mid-air. Then, care<span class="pagenum" id="Page_114">114</span>fully
but as quickly as possible, Frank found fresh footholds,
and so lessened the weight on his end of the rope.
Just as he had planned, Darrel began slipping downward,
the rope sliding through Frank’s hands and around the
tree trunk.</p>

<p>Drooping limply in the noose that encircled his body,
Darrel twisted and swayed in sickening fashion as he
dropped foot by foot down the face of the cliff. In a
few minutes he had been lowered into the outstretched
arms of Ballard and Clancy, and the lads below sent up
a cheer that reverberated loudly between the cañon walls.</p>

<p>Frank’s descent was made safely and speedily, for he
knotted the rope around the trunk of the tree and slid
down its length to the side of his chums. Ballard had
Darrel’s head on his knee, and Clancy had gone to the
creek for a capful of cold water. Merriwell, breathing
heavily, dropped down on the rocks.</p>

<p>“You got that rope around Darrel just in the nick of
time, Chip!” said the admiring Ballard. “If you had
been a second later, Darrel would have brought both of
you down in a heap. Gee, man, but it was a close call!”</p>

<p>“A miss is as good as a mile, Pink,” answered Merry.</p>

<p>Clancy arrived with the water and allowed it to trickle
over the white, haggard face of the unconscious lad. Darrel’s
eyes flickered open, and a haunting expression of
pain was in them as they rested on his friends. He
ground his teeth to stifle a groan.</p>

<p>“Are you badly hurt, Darrel?” queried Frank.</p>

<p>“My—my left arm,” panted Darrel, “it’s broken, I
think.”</p>

<p>With a muttered exclamation, Frank threw himself to
his knees close beside Darrel. As he lifted him by the
shoulders, the left arm swung limply and a moan was
wrenched from Darrel’s lips.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_115">115</span></p>

<p>“The arm is broken,” said Frank, “there’s no doubt
about that. Clan,” he added, “go to the camp for our
mounts. You needn’t bring a horse for Darrel—he can
ride behind me on Borak.”</p>

<p>“Going to take him to Ophir?” asked Clancy, bounding
to his feet and starting up the cañon.</p>

<p>“No, to Dolliver’s. Hustle, old man!”</p>

<p>Clancy disappeared up the narrow trail at a keen run.</p>

<p>“I—I’ve made a monkey’s fist of this, all right,” muttered
Darrel. “If I’d left you alone, Chip, you’d have
got the ball with ground to spare. But I had to try to
star myself, and this is what comes of it.”</p>

<p>“Don’t fret about that, old man,” said Merry. “The
thing to do now is to have the arm attended to.”</p>

<p>“Why don’t you take him to the camp?” asked Ballard.
“We could get there in a mighty small part of the time
it would take to reach Dolliver’s.”</p>

<p>“Darrel has got to have a comfortable bed, for one
thing, Pink,” Merry answered. “Mainly, though, we can
use the phone from Dolliver’s and get the doctor out from
Ophir by motor car. By going to the ranch at the mouth
of the cañon, we’ll not only save time, but make Darrel
more comfortable into the bargain.”</p>

<p>“What happened to me?” queried Darrel, smothering
his pain with a heroic effort. “Did I drop all the way
down the cliff wall? I can’t remember a thing after hitting
the shelf.”</p>

<p>“You rolled off the shelf and lodged on a bowlder,”
Frank answered. “We got you down by means of the
rope.”</p>

<p>“‘We’ didn’t have a thing to do with it,” spoke up
Ballard. “It was Chip did it all, Darrel. He swarmed
up the side of the cliff with the rope, took a half hitch
around a bit of a tree, and then lowered——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_116">116</span></p>

<p>“Don’t worry him with all that,” struck in Merry. “Just
lie as quietly as you can, Darrel. Here, put your head
on this.”</p>

<p>Jerking off his coat, he rolled it up for a pillow, and
Darrel was gently lowered until he was lying at full
length on the rocks. His eyes closed. Although he made
no sound, yet the contracting muscles of his face showed
that he was fighting hard with pain.</p>

<p>At last a clatter of hoofs announced the coming of
Clancy with two led horses. Handy and the rest had
not returned from up the cañon, and Clancy had seen
nothing of Fritz, Silva, or the professor. Because of his
failure to see anybody at the camp, he had been unable to
report the accident.</p>

<p>“Everybody will know about it soon enough, Clan,”
said Frank. “Now, you ride on to Dolliver’s as fast as
you can and use the phone. Ask Mr. Bradlaugh to bring
out the doctor in his motor car. Ballard and I will come
on with Darrel.”</p>

<p>“On the jump,” answered Clancy.</p>

<p>Merriwell took the reins of the led horses, and the red-headed
chap dug in with his heels and vanished toward
the mouth of the cañon.</p>

<small>QUICK WORK FOR DARREL.</small></h2>


<p>“There’s a little ginger left in me, pards,” murmured
Darrel, sitting up. “I’m not letting a busted wing put
me down and out entirely.”</p>

<p>He got up slowly and stood beside Ballard.</p>

<p>“You’re to ride behind me, old man,” said Merriwell.
“I’ll mount, Pink, and then you help him up.”</p>

<p>Frank swung into the saddle, pulled the restive Borak
down sharply, and kicked a foot out of the stirrup for
Darrel’s use. Darrel was game, if ever a boy was. With
a little aid from Ballard, he succeeded in getting astride
the horse, and held himself there with his right arm
around Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Can you hang on, Darrel?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Sure,” was the reply. “Just hurry, that’s all.”</p>

<p>With a shouted request for Ballard to follow, Frank
headed Borak down the gulch. Five miles lay between
Tinaja Wells and the ranch at the mouth of the cañon
known as Dolliver’s. There was no horse in that part of
the country that could cover the ground more speedily
than Borak. Knowing that the ride was plain torture
for Darrel, Frank sought to get it over with as quickly
as possible.</p>

<p>Although the broken arm swung cruelly during the
rough ride, yet never once did so much as a whimper
escape Darrel’s lips. In less than half an hour the
treacherous trail was covered, and Frank drew up in front
of the ranch building. Both Dolliver and Clancy were
in front to receive the injured lad. It was well that they<span class="pagenum" id="Page_118">118</span>
were there, and ready, for no sooner had Borak been
drawn to a halt than Darrel pitched sideways from his
back. He was caught in the outstretched arms of the
rancher and Clancy, and swiftly borne into the house.</p>

<p>Ballard came up, a moment later, and he and Frank
dismounted, secured their horses at the hitching post,
and went in to learn what luck Clancy had had with his
telephoning.</p>

<p>“The doctor’s on the way, Chip,” said Clancy. “I got
Mr. Bradlaugh right off the reel. He said he knew the
doctor was in town, and that he would be snatching him
toward Dolliver’s in less than five minutes. That wasn’t
so very long ago, though. You must have ridden like
blazes to get here so quick.”</p>

<p>The agony of the rapid ride down the gulch must have
been intense for Darrel. He had kept himself in hand
pretty well until reaching Dolliver’s, and then a wave of
weakness had blotted out his endurance.</p>

<p>A bed in the main room of the ranch was ready for
him, and he was now lying in it, as comfortable as he
could possibly be under the circumstances.</p>

<p>“I’m putting you fellows to a heap of trouble,” remarked
Darrel weakly.</p>

<p>“Oh, bother that!” answered Merry. “It’s mighty good
to know that you’ve come off with only a broken arm.
You’ll not be laid up long, old man.”</p>

<p>“I’m wondering how that rope happened to give way.
It——”</p>

<p>“Don’t wonder about a blooming thing, Darrel. Wait
till you feel better.”</p>

<p>“I can’t get it out of my mind,” persisted Darrel.
“Where did it break? Did you see?”</p>

<p>“It broke in the place where you had it looped around
the paloverde,” said Ballard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_119">119</span></p>

<p>“Strike me lucky!” muttered Darrel, a puzzled look
battling with the pain in his face. “Why, it couldn’t
have broken there! That rope was Clan’s reata, and was
as sound as any rope you ever saw.”</p>

<p>“That’s what happened, anyhow,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m blamed if I can understand it!”</p>

<p>Frank and the other two were also at a loss to understand
it. There was certainly something queer about the
breaking of that rope.</p>

<p>A little later, the hum of a motor car was heard along
the trail.</p>

<p>“Mr. Bradlaugh has come over the road for a record,”
remarked Clancy, starting for the door. “But I knew
he’d hit ’er up.”</p>

<p>When the boys reached the front of the house, the
big car was just slowing to a halt.</p>

<p>“Nothing but a broken arm, eh, boys?” asked Mr.
Bradlaugh, as the doctor tumbled out with his surgical
case.</p>

<p>“That’s all, sir,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>“I didn’t catch the name over the phone. Whose arm
was it? Not Hannibal’s?”</p>

<p>“No, Darrel’s.”</p>

<p>Bradlaugh’s face suddenly clouded.</p>

<p>“That young rascal, eh?” he muttered.</p>

<p>Frank was quick to catch the significance of Mr. Bradlaugh’s
remark.</p>

<p>“You know something about Ellis Darrel, Mr. Bradlaugh?”
he asked.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_120">120</span></p>
<p>“I know that his uncle made a home for him, treated
him indulgently in every way, and that he rewarded
Hawtrey by forging his name to pay a gambling debt.
I was sorry to hear that you’d taken up with the fellow,
Merriwell, or that you were making room for him in
the Ophir camp. He’s a wild one, and won’t do any of
you much good.”</p>

<p>Here was an impression which Frank was determined
to change for one of another sort. While Clancy and
Ballard were helping the doctor set the broken arm, and
while an occasional groan of pain echoed out through
the open ranch door, Frank leaned against the side of the
car and earnestly explained a few things to Mr. Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>He went into the details of that thousand-dollar robbery,
just as he had done once before for the benefit of
Colonel Hawtrey, and by the time he had finished his defense
of Darrel, Mr. Bradlaugh was almost convinced
that he had made a wrong estimate of “the boy from
Nowhere.”</p>

<p>“Well, well,” smiled the president of the Ophir Athletic
Club, “you’re a red-hot champion of Darrel’s anyhow.
If you’re so positive that the boy has been a victim
of some designing scoundrel, I can’t help but think there
may be some mistake about that forgery matter. Hawtrey’s
a very wealthy man, and the only ones he can leave
his property to are Jode Lenning and Ellis Darrel. If
Darrel is out of it, then it all goes to Lenning. There’s
a point that demands consideration. I don’t know much
about Lenning except that he’s a pretty good sprinter, and
seems to be the apple of the colonel’s eye—now that Darrel
appears to have gone to the bad. If you think you’re
doing the right thing by taking up with Darrel, all right.
I’m willing to trust to your judgment. And now, tell
me, how’s everything at Tinaja Wells?”</p>

<p>“Fine as silk,” Frank answered. “This accident of
Darrel’s is the first one we’ve had.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_121">121</span></p>
<p>“How did it happen?”</p>

<p>Frank recounted the details, in a general way, putting
himself very much in the background.</p>

<p>“Own up,” smiled Mr. Bradlaugh; “you’re the one who
picked Darrel off the shelf, and kept him from breaking
his neck as well as his arm. Isn’t that the size of it?”</p>

<p>Merriwell dodged the question as well as he could,
and began telling about Hawtrey’s visit to the camp, and
his proposals. Mr. Bradlaugh was in hearty agreement
with the colonel.</p>

<p>“It’s up to you, boys,” said he, “to wipe out this bitterness
between the two clubs while you are out in the hills
in neighboring camps. If that’s accomplished, it will be
something worth while. Remember, too, all Ophir is
counting on you to give us a winning eleven for the game
with Gold Hill.”</p>

<p>“I’ll do my best,” Frank answered. “Won’t you come
in, Mr. Bradlaugh, and meet Darrel?”</p>

<p>“He’s probably in no condition to make acquaintances
now,” answered Mr. Bradlaugh, shaking his head; “and,
besides,” he added, “I’d a good deal rather shake hands
with him after you prove he’s innocent of forging his
uncle’s name.”</p>

<p>In an hour, the doctor’s work was finished. The
broken arm had been set and bandaged with splints, and
there was an odor of drugs around Dolliver’s and much
relief and satisfaction in the minds of Frank and his
chums. There were no internal injuries, so far as the
doctor could see, and, in a month or so, Darrel was promised
that he should be as well as ever.</p>

<p>It was growing dark, by that time, and, as Frank knew
the lads at the camp would be wondering over the absence
of most of those left on guard duty, he and Clancy started
back to Tinaja Wells shortly after Mr. Bradlaugh had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_122">122</span>
whirled away toward town with the doctor. Ballard
was to remain behind and look after Darrel.</p>

<p>It was eight o’clock when Merriwell and Clancy rode
up on the flat and got wearily down from their horses.
As Silva hurried up and took the mounts, a throng of
lads surrounded the latecomers.</p>

<p>“Where the dickens have you fellows been?” demanded
Hannibal Bradlaugh. “Fritz has been howling his Dutch
head off trying to get you to come to supper. And that
was all of two hours ago. The last seen of you, you
were on your way down the cañon to help Clancy and
Ballard get that football that Silva had kicked over the
cliff. Some of us went down there looking for you, but
all we could find was a rope hanging from a stunted tree
on the cliffside. It was the biggest kind of a mystery.
And it only got deeper and deeper when Silva discovered
that mounts belonging to you, Ballard and Clancy had
vanished from the herd. Come across with the news,
Chip. We’re all of us on tenterhooks.”</p>

<p>“Can’t we eat while we’re palavering?” wailed Clancy.
“I feel as though I hadn’t hit a grub layout for a week.”</p>

<p>“Come on mit yoursellufs,” said Fritz, “und haf a
leedle someding vich I peen keeping hot. Dit you get
der pall?”</p>

<p>“Hang the ball!” answered Clancy, “we’ve had something
else to think of.”</p>

<p>While they ate, the two chums told of the accident to
Darrel, and how they had taken him to Dolliver’s and
left him there with Ballard. There was general regret
expressed on every hand, for Darrel, greeted with distrust
when he had first reached the camp, was fast becoming
a prime favorite.</p>

<p>“While we were hiking back down the cañon,” said
Handy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_123">123</span> “we met Hawtrey. We talked with him for a
spell, and he batted up that proposition of competing in
a friendly way with the Gold Hillers. He said you favored
it. When we reached camp we found Lenning and
Bleeker, from Camp Hawtrey, waiting for us. They
proposed a football game for to-morrow afternoon, and
I took them on for two fifteen minutes of play. Didn’t
think it best to tire the boys for a full game. I reckon,
though, that I’d better send over to their camp and call
it off.”</p>

<p>“Don’t you do it, Handy,” protested Merriwell. “Let
’em come. I’m particularly anxious to get better acquainted
with Jode Lenning.”</p>

<p>Handy and Brad studied Frank’s face earnestly, for a
minute, and then they both chuckled.</p>

<p>“I see your signal smoke, Chip,” grinned Handy.
“You’re thinking of Darrel. All right, we’ll let them
come; and I hope something happens, during the set-to,
that will be of some benefit to Curly.”</p>

<small>UGLY SUSPICIONS.</small></h2>


<p>Before Spink, on a battered old bugle, sounded reveille
for the camp, next morning, Merriwell and Clancy
crawled out of their tent, took a dip in the swimming
pool, hurriedly dressed, and went down the cañon. The
object of their secret expedition was to recover the rope
which had given way under Darrel’s weight, the preceding
afternoon. This rope, it will be remembered, had
been left tied to the stunted tree when Merriwell descended
to the cañon bed after lowering the unfortunate
Darrel.</p>

<p>Clancy, first to reach the trailing cable, examined the
end of it and then flung it from him disappointedly.</p>

<p>“Hang the luck!” he exclaimed; “this is the wrong end,
Chip.”</p>

<p>Merriwell laughed.</p>

<p>“Of course, it’s the wrong end,” said he. “The end
that was tied to the paloverde is up close to the place
where Darrel was hanging from the bowlder. You see,
Clan, when the rope dropped, the end that had not been
tied to the tree lay uppermost. One end was as good as
another to me, so I lashed that to my waist and carried
it up to Darrel. That, of course, was the end I made
fast around Darrel’s body, and it came down with him,
leaving the end we want to examine pretty much aloft.”</p>

<p>“Another climb has to be made in order to get it?”</p>

<p>“Sure, old man, unless you can think of another way
for getting it down.”</p>

<p>This was more than Clancy had bargained for. He<span class="pagenum" id="Page_125">125</span>
had thought that about all he and Merry would have to
do would be to walk down the cañon, cut off the end of
the rope they were interested in, then stroll back to camp
and examine the section of hemp at their leisure. But
Merry, as usual, had considered the matter more thoroughly.</p>

<p>“I nearly had heart failure,” said Clancy, “when you
made the climb yesterday. Pass it up, Chip. It’s just
a spasm of curiosity on our part, anyhow. It would be
rank foolishness for you to risk your neck because we’re
curious as to how the rope happened to break.”</p>

<p>“I’ve a notion, Clan,” returned Merriwell soberly, “that
this breaking of the rope reaches deeper than we imagine.”</p>

<p>“How so?”</p>

<p>“There may be a plot back of it.”</p>

<p>“A plot?” The color faded from Clancy’s homely
face and left the freckles standing out in prominent
blotches. “You don’t mean,” he gasped, “that there was
a plot to—to kill Darrel?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t said so, and just now I don’t want to go on
record as thinking of such a dastardly thing. All the
same, though, I’ll have a look at the other end of that
rope if it takes a leg.”</p>

<p>“If that’s the way you feel about it,” said Clancy, “you
can bet a ripe persimmon I’m not going to let you hog all
the dangerous work. Uncle Clancy will do the climbing
this morning, and work up an appetite for breakfast.”</p>

<p>“Not much you don’t,” was Merriwell’s decided answer,
as he flung off his coat and laid hold of the rope.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_126">126</span>
“Recovering the rope was my idea, and I’m going up
there, cut off what I need, and come back with it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll draw straws,” urged the red-headed fellow.
“The fellow that gets the short one goes up.”</p>

<p>“Just consider that I drew the short one,” chuckled
Merry, and began to climb.</p>

<p>Clancy growled as he watched his chum hand over
hand his way up the first twenty feet, then allow his legs
to help his arms the rest of the distance. It was all
so easily and so cleverly done that Clancy lost his apprehensions.</p>

<p>“You’re certainly all to the mustard, Chip,” he called.
“Don’t linger too long, though. I’m hungry to have a
look at the upper end of that rope myself.”</p>

<p>Frank, climbing to the bowlder which had caught Darrel
in his fall, wedged himself comfortably between the
stunted tree and the face of the cliff, swung his legs out
over space and began an examination of the cable.</p>

<p>There were two ends to it, for it had been looped
around the paloverde and had given away in the middle
of the loop. What Frank discovered he did not make
known to his anxious chum at that moment. Severing a
four-foot section of the rope, he tied it about his waist,
cautiously arose to his feet on the bowlder and began
climbing again.</p>

<p>“Where the mischief are you going now, Chip?” bellowed
Clancy.</p>

<p>Frank was too busy to answer. Presently the lad
below saw him hang to the rocks and reach over the edge
of the shelf. The next moment, the lost football came
bounding down into the cañon.</p>

<p>“Darn!” roared Clancy.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_127">127</span> “I should think that confounded
ball has caused trouble enough without making
you take any more chances to get hold of it. I guess it
wouldn’t bankrupt the O.  A. C to lose a five-dollar pigskin.”</p>

<p>“We’ll need that in the game this afternoon, Clan,”
shouted Merry.</p>

<p>Then he slid back to the bowlder, sat down on it,
swung off on the stunted tree, and came down the rope
as easily as though it had been a ladder.</p>

<p>“You wanted to show off,” jeered Clancy, “and I guess
you made out to do it. Now take that piece of rope
from your waist and let’s look at it.”</p>

<p>Silently Merriwell untied the section of rope and
handed it to Clancy. The latter took it in his hands,
examined it, and looked up, startled.</p>

<p>“Well, what do you think?” Merriwell asked.</p>

<p>“It didn’t break, Chip.”</p>

<p>“No.”</p>

<p>“It was cut.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Merriwell. “The strands of hemp were
severed with a sharp instrument of some kind. It was
a clean stroke that separated Darrel’s lifeline from the
paloverde, Clan.”</p>

<p>“What scoundrel——”</p>

<p>“Keep your shirt on, Red,” broke in Frank. “At this
stage of the game there’s no use guessing about who did
it or why it was done. We can suppose that somebody
crept into the greasewood, watched Darrel as he lowered
himself, and then struck the rope with the edge of a
knife, or a hatchet. The rope would have cut easily.
The loop was drawn taut against the paloverde by Darrel’s
weight, and——”</p>

<p>Horror had been slowly rising in Clancy’s eyes.</p>

<p>“What wretch,” he whispered, “what infernal villain,
would have dared to do a thing like that?”</p>

<p>“There you are again,” said Merriwell calmly,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_128">128</span> “trying
to guess who it was might attempt such a devilish piece
of work. If you keep that up, first thing you know you’ll
be doing some one an injustice. After all, you know,
Darrel’s fall might really have been due to an accident.”</p>

<p>“Maybe I’m thick, but I’ll swear I can’t see how it
could have been an accident.”</p>

<p>“Suppose the reata, in kicking around the camp, had
been accidentally cut into near that particular end? Suppose
Darrel, in tying the rope about the paloverde, didn’t
notice the weak spot?”</p>

<p>At first Clancy was impressed with this reasoning; then,
when his wits had a little time to work, he believed he
saw the fallacy of it.</p>

<p>“If it had been like that, Chip,” said he, “a few strands
would have been left torn and ragged where they had
broken. But that’s not the case. Every strand shows
a keen, clear cut. Your argument won’t hold water.”</p>

<p>“Possibly not,” agreed Merriwell, his face hardening,
“but I’d rather, ten times over, think this was an accident
rather than a deliberate attempt on the part of some
fiend to put Darrel out of the way. We may have our
suspicions, ugly suspicions, but let’s keep them to ourselves
until we get a little further light on this business.
If no light ever comes—well, we’ll throw the piece of
rope away and try to forget all about it. It’s an awful
thing, Clancy, to think there was a deliberate plan to
throw Darrel down the face of that cliff. There goes
the bugle,” he added, getting into his coat. “Mum’s the
word, Clan, when we get back to camp.”</p>

<p>Coiling up the piece of rope, Merry thrust it under
his coat, where it could not be seen. Very thoughtfully
the two lads returned to Tinaja Wells.</p>

<p>Professor Phineas Borrodaile was in front of the tent,
jointly occupied by himself and Frank and his chums,
carefully combing what little hair nature had spared him.
A three-cornered piece of looking-glass, hung against the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_129">129</span>
canvas-tent wall, aided him somewhat in making his
toilet.</p>

<p>Fritz, moving toward the chuck tent with an armful
of wood, sighted the ball under Clancy’s arm. He gave
a whoop of delight, and dropped the wood.</p>

<p>“Py shinks,” he cried, “you got him! Vat a habbiness
iss dot! Say, Merrivell, now I can lick dot greaser feller,
don’d it, mitoudt gedding tocked der fife tollar?”</p>

<p>“Lay a hand on Silva,” answered Frank, glaring at
Fritz and winking an off eye at Clancy, “and you’ll lose
the five, ball or no ball.”</p>

<p>Fritz looked grieved, and slowly picked up his wood
and waddled away with it. Clancy threw the ball into
the tent and dropped down in the shade beside Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said the professor, a troubled look in his
face, “ever since I returned to camp yesterday afternoon
I have found myself vastly concerned over this accident
to Darrel—vastly concerned. In fact, I may say I have
become obsessed with the idea that some one—I cannot
say who—may be entangled in the affair in a—er—guilty
manner. Tell me, if you please, do you consider that
what happened to Darrel was an accident?”</p>

<p>The professor doubled up his pocket comb like a jackknife
and stowed it away in his pocket. Then, adjusting
his glasses, he peered over the tops of them at Frank.</p>

<p>“How could it have been anything else, professor?”</p>

<p>“You are beating about the bush, Merriwell,” reproved
the professor; “you are not frank with me. Do you,
sir, consider the breaking of that rope an accident, or
not?”</p>

<p>“Not,” spoke up Clancy.</p>

<p>“From the facts at hand,” replied Merriwell,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_130">130</span> “it is
hard to say what it was.”</p>

<p>“I speak in this manner,” went on Professor Borrodaile,
“because, shortly before the supposed accident happened,
I was among the rocks to the south of that particular
part of the cañon. I heard high words from beyond a bit
of chaparral, as of two men quarreling. I had no interest
in the quarrel, if such it was, so I sought to avoid
the men and proceed with my examination of the rocks
adjacent to the cañon’s brink. And yet, I had a glimpse
of the disputatious pair. One of them, I am sure, was
Jode Lenning; the other was the young man called
Bleeker.”</p>

<p>Clancy cast a startled look at Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Later,” went on the professor, “much later, Lenning
and Bleeker appeared in this camp and spoke to Handy.
Where were Lenning and Bleeker during the interim?
I confess, Merriwell, that the thought annoys me. It certainly
could not have taken the two Gold Hill young men
an hour or more to come from the place where I saw
them to Tinaja Wells. What do you think?”</p>

<p>Just then Fritz came forth and announced “grub pile”
in his usual hearty manner, and Merry did not find it
necessary to tell Professor Borrodaile what he thought.</p>

<small>A FRIEND FROM CAMP HAWTREY.</small></h2>


<p>Darrel passed a restless night at Dolliver’s ranch. His
arm, stiffly wrapped with splints and bandages, was swollen
and feverish. The pain of it must have been intense.</p>

<p>Ballard did what he could to cheer Darrel up. The
boy with the broken arm, however, had mental worries
apart from his physical pains, and it was hard for Ballard
to do anything with him. As the forenoon wore
on, Darrel began to talk, and to reveal the troubles that
lay at the back of his head.</p>

<p>“Pink,” said he, with an air of desperation, “I’ve got to
do something to clear up that forgery matter. The colonel
won’t have a thing to do with me until I prove that I
didn’t sign his name to that check.”</p>

<p>“Chip’s going to look after that, old man,” returned
Ballard. “Leave it to him. You’ve got enough to fret
about, seems to me, without going into any of your family
affairs.”</p>

<p>“It’s on my mind a whole lot, pard,” continued Darrel,
gritting his teeth to keep back a groan. “I hate to be
treated like a yellow dog by Uncle Alvah. If I had
really forged the check, then I’m getting no more than
what’s coming to me; but I didn’t—I’d take my oath I
didn’t.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_132">132</span></p>

<p>“What’s that old saw about, ‘Truth, crushed to earth,
will rise again’? Just keep your shirt on, and wait.
In the end, everything will come out O.  K. Chip’s on
the trail, and you can bet a pinch of snuff against a bone
collar button that he’ll run it out. Take matters easy,
Darrel, and wait for Merriwell to play his hand.”</p>

<p>“I can’t leave it all to him,” fretted Darrel.</p>

<p>“You’ve got to leave it to somebody until you can get
up and around, haven’t you? A few days, or weeks,
won’t make any difference. That forgery business has
been hanging fire for more than a year, and I guess there
isn’t any great rush about clearing it up right now.”</p>

<p>Darrel squirmed impatiently as he lay in the bed.</p>

<p>“It was different,” said he, “when I was drifting around
in other parts of the West. Then I was among strangers,
and nobody knew anything about me. Now that I’m back
on this range, I can’t meet a soul but knows I’m the
nephew that disgraced the colonel’s family, and I’m
looked on with contempt. Even Dolliver acts as though
he thought I was a criminal.”</p>

<p>“Gammon! Say, Darrel, your imagination is working
overtime. Dolliver’s manner is all that can be desired.
I haven’t seen a thing in his actions to suggest that he
looks on you as a jailbird.”</p>

<p>“I can see it, Pink, even if you can’t,” insisted Darrel.
“Things have got to be different, and they’ve got to
change mighty soon.”</p>

<p>“Leave it to Merry. He, and all the rest of us, believe
in you, and are working for you. Something will turn
up, take it from me, and there’s no earthly use in your
worrying yourself blue in the face because it doesn’t turn
up right away.”</p>

<p>“The colonel thinks a heap of Jode,” murmured Darrel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_133">133</span></p>
<p>“Jode is a soft-sawdering beggar, and knows how to
get around him. It gets my goat the way a man as smart
as the old colonel allows himself to be taken in. But
it can’t last. Hawtrey’s eyes are bound to be opened
some time.”</p>

<p>“I don’t want to be the one that strips the mask away
from Jode. In order to believe that Jode is a schemer,
the colonel will have to find it out for himself.”</p>

<p>“You can’t be too ladylike about it. When you fight
the devil, you know, you’ve got to use fire.”</p>

<p>Noon came, and the early hours of afternoon began
drifting away. It was about two o’clock when a visitor
dropped in at Dolliver’s. He came on horseback, left his
mount at Dolliver’s hitching pole, and pushed a bulletlike
head through the door of the front room.</p>

<p>“How’s the patient?” he asked of Ballard.</p>

<p>Ballard recognized the fellow as one Mark Hotchkiss,
a Gold Hiller belonging with the rival camp.</p>

<p>“Come in, and ask him yourself,” Ballard answered.</p>

<p>A bony youth of seventeen projected himself through
the door. Darrel turned his head on the pillow and
looked at him.</p>

<p>“Hello, Hotch,” said he. “What’re you doing here?”</p>

<p>“Came to find out how you’re makin’ it,” grinned
Hotchkiss.</p>

<p>“You Gold Hill chaps must be worrying a lot about
me,” said Darrel sarcastically.</p>

<p>“There’s a few of us who don’t think you’ve had a
square deal, El. Jode’s king bee at our camp, and there’s
some of the junipers over there that ain’t got the nerve
to call their souls their own. I’m my own boss, I reckon.
Nearly all of our crowd have gone to Tinaja Wells for
a football game this afternoon. Bleeker and me and one
or two more was left behind.”</p>

<p>“Bleeker!” exclaimed Darrel. “Why, he’s one of the
strongest men on the football squad!”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_134">134</span></p>
<p>“Sure, but Jode’s hot at him, and Jode’s captain of the
eleven, so he carries his grouch to the extent of orderin’
those he don’t like to stay behind.”</p>

<p>“Why is Jode hot at Bleeker?”</p>

<p>“That’s too many for me. They ain’t hardly spoke
to each other since they got back from the Ophir camp
yesterday. You see, them two went to the Wells to fix
up the details of the game, and they was as chummy
as you please when they left Camp Hawtrey, but they
come back mad as blazes at each other.”</p>

<p>“Maybe,” suggested Ballard, “Bleeker’s beginning to
find out some things about Jode that don’t set well.”</p>

<p>“Like enough,” grinned Hotchkiss. “The football players
made for Tinaja Wells on foot, ‘cross country. Parkman
was late in startin’, and just before he pulled out,
Bleeker, with a face like a thundercloud, rushed from his
tent with a note all sealed up in an envelope. He hands
it to Parkman. ‘Give that to Lenning on the q.  t.,’ says
Bleeker; ‘tell him it’s from me, and it’s about El Darrel,’
he says, ‘and about Merriwell a little, too,’ he says. ‘I
don’t want to get myself in no trouble with Jode,’ says
Parkman, half a mind not to have a thing to do with the
note. ‘You’ll get yourself into a whole lot of trouble
with me,’ Bleeker says, ‘if you don’t do as I want.’ So,
with that, Park takes the note and slips it away some’r’s
inside his uniform. I reckon Jode’ll get it, all right.”</p>

<p>Darrel was developing a strong interest in that note of
Bleeker’s.</p>

<p>“What had Bleeker to tell Lenning about me,” he asked,
“that he couldn’t bat up to him without putting it in a
letter?”</p>

<p>“Kin savvy?” returned Hotchkiss, giving the local
equivalent for the Mexican <i lang ="es-mx">quien sabe</i>—who knows?<span class="pagenum" id="Page_135">135</span> “A
few of us what was left behind at Camp Hawtrey put
our heads together and sort of made up our minds about
somethin’. That’s mainly the reason I’m here, El. You
see, the reason Jode’s down on a few of us is because
we was stickin’ up for you. We told Jode flat that we
didn’t take no stock in that forgery business, and reckoned
you’d clear yourself some day. That made Jode madder’n
hops. All those that kept their mouths shut Jode
took to Tinaja Wells.”</p>

<p>Ballard was almost as deeply interested in Hotchkiss’
remarks as was Darrel. Here was a friend from the
rival camp, and he brought news that might be of great
value.</p>

<p>“Now,” pursued Hotchkiss, “us fellers that was left
behind—barrin’ Bleeker—sort of made up our minds that
the note Parkman’s totin’ maybe contains a clew about the
forgery matter. Bleeker, as you know, El, has been
mighty close to Jode for a couple o’ years or more. Them
two was thicker’n two peas in a pod at the time the
colonel turned you adrift. It looks to a few of us as
though Bleek’s had an attack of conscience, or somethin’,
and has put on paper a few things that may be
pretty important to you. I was delegated to come over
here, tell you about the note, and suggest a plan of
action.”</p>

<p>“What plan?”</p>

<p>Darrel’s eyes were big and bright, and he rose on his
right elbow and peered earnestly at Hotchkiss.</p>

<p>“Well, you got friends in the Ophir camp,” said Hotchkiss.
“Have ’em get that note away from Parkman; or,
if it’s too late to get it from Parkman, then have ’em take
it from Jode.”</p>

<p>“It’s Lenning’s letter,” put in Ballard. “What business
have Darrel’s friends with it?”</p>

<p>“If it comes to that, what business have Bleek and Len
with evidence clearin’ Darrel of that forgery?”</p>

<p>“How do you know the letter contains anything like
that?” demanded Ballard.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_136">136</span></p>

<p>“I reckon us fellers in the Gold Hill camp ain’t deef,
dumb, and blind,” bristled Hotchkiss. “We’ve kept our
eyes and ears open, we have. A bunch of us is friends
of El’s, here, and we allow he’s goin’ to clear himself.
What Bleek knows about that forgery he’s put into that
letter, more’n likely, and right here’s a chance for El to
be cleared by a little snappy work. You see, Bleek’s so
mad at Jode he won’t speak to him, and Jode’s so mad at
Bleek he won’t take him to Tinaja Wells. Maybe he’s
afeared, if Bleek was near Merriwell, that he’d split on
the hull business.”</p>

<p>Darrel swerved his glimmering eyes to Ballard.</p>

<p>“Pink,” said he, deeply stirred, “I’m banking on Hotchkiss
and the few friends I have in Camp Hawtrey. Meddling
with correspondents that doesn’t concern the meddler
is pretty bum business, but we have Bleeker’s word
for it that the letter he sent Jode concerns me—and
Merriwell, too. Doesn’t that give us the right to get hold
of it, if we can?”</p>

<p>“That’s a pretty fine point,” frowned Ballard, “but I
should say that you and Chip have a right to that letter.”</p>

<p>“Sure,” exploded Hotchkiss, “they have a right to it!
The next thing is for some of you friends of El’s to get
it. I’ve done all I can.” Hotchkiss got up, stepped to
the side of the bed, and took Darrel’s hand. “Some of
us Gold Hillers, pard,” he went on, “have pinned our
faith to you. We can’t say much, or do much, because
the colonel purty nigh owns the club, and because Jode
stands ace high with the colonel. But we’ve put you wise
to this letter, and it’s up to your Ophir friends to help
you out. Somethin’ will have to be done pretty quick, I
reckon, for that game’s due to come off before long.
Some day, El,” and Hotchkiss dropped Darrel’s hand and
started for the door,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_137">137</span> “I hope you’ll get Lenning on the
mat for the count. He’s a two-faced coyote, and that
shot goes as it lays. <i lang ="es-mx">Adios!</i>”</p>

<p>A few moments later, the hoofs of the Gold Hill boy’s
horse could be heard drumming a diminishing tattoo up
the cañon.</p>

<p>“Are my Ophir pards going to help me, Pink?” queried
Darrel.</p>

<p>“You can bet your life they are, Darrel!” answered
Ballard. “Think you can get along while I ride to Tinaja
Wells, and put this up to Chip?”</p>

<p>“Sure I can,” and a look of happiness overspread Darrel’s
face. “At last,” he murmured, “I think I’m on the
right track.”</p>

<p>“Here’s hoping,” said Ballard blithely. “I’m off on the
keen jump, old man,” and he rushed from the house to get
his horse under saddle.</p>

<p>A little later, he flashed past the door, waved his hat
in a parting salute to Darrel, and pushed at speed in the
direction of Tinaja Wells.</p>

<small>TRYING TO BE FRIENDLY.</small></h2>


<p>During the forenoon of the day that was to witness
the preliminary skirmish with Gold Hill, Frank’s mind
was not wholly on his studies. He had been disturbed
by his examination of the severed rope, and by the professor’s
remarks concerning Jode Lenning and Bleeker.
It was impossible for Frank to get away from the ugly
suspicions of foul play that had taken hold of him. He
felt relieved when Fritz sang out the dinner call, and
books and recitations could be dismissed for the rest of
the day.</p>

<p>Following the noon meal, Merry collected the football
squad and started in to give them a little talk.</p>

<p>“Now, fellows,” said he, “we’re going to have thirty
minutes of play with Gold Hill this afternoon, and I want
every one of you to be right up on your toes. Gold Hill
is going to watch you to see whether you have improved
any over last year, and we’re going to keep our eyes peeled
for weak points in the Gold Hill team. I don’t think
they’ll find out any more about us than we will find out
about them, so honors will be easy. Play the game,
that’s all. The mesa isn’t quite so good as the O.  A.  C.
athletic field, but it’s plenty good enough for this little
try-out. I’m not at all particular whether you win a
little sawed-off preliminary set-to like this one, but I <em>am</em>
mighty particular that you don’t let Gold Hill win. Hold
them.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_139">139</span></p>
<p>“Another thing: There has been too much knock-down
and drag-out in this rivalry between Gold Hill and
Ophir. A petty feeling of partisanship has crept into
all the contests between the two clubs, and it has reached
a point where it has become a disgrace. It’s up to you,
by your actions to-day, to wipe out the bitterness. Colonel
Hawtrey is anxious to have an era of good feeling
crop out between the rival clubs, and I guess it’s about
time something of the sort did crop out if every contest
doesn’t end in a free-for-all rough-house. The colonel
says the Gold Hill fellows will meet us halfway in friendly
sport, and I know that you will do your part to have
everything pleasant and agreeable. Mr. Bradlaugh wants
it that way, too. He told me so himself, and what he
says ought to carry a good deal of weight. Let’s be true
sportsmen, fellows, and when the other squad comes over
here, just remember that bygones are to be bygones, and
that, with this afternoon, we’re setting a new mark in
the competitions with Gold Hill.”</p>

<p>A cheer, which tried to be hearty, greeted Merriwell’s
remarks. Handy, the captain, stepped out to ease himself
of a few words.</p>

<p>“Most of you were up the cañon with me yesterday
afternoon,” said he, “and heard the talk I had with
Colonel Hawtrey. The colonel’s as fine as they make ‘em,
fellows, and he’ll do his part to keep the Gold Hillers in
line. I reckon we’ll do ours. From now on, instead
of being licked by Gold Hill, every clatter out of the box,
we’re going to do some of the licking ourselves. It’s a
fine thing to be a good loser, but it’s just as fine, according
to my notion, to be a good winner, and show some
consideration for the other fellow. Gold Hill never
showed us much consideration, but we’re going to forget
the habit they used to have of ‘rubbing it in.’ All we’re
to remember is that we’re making a cut for a new deal
to-day, and that we’re meeting on neutral territory<span class="pagenum" id="Page_140">140</span>—
which is a good place to start the good work. We’re
to play thirty minutes, with a fifteen-minute interval between
the quarters. Be a credit to Ophir. That’s all.”</p>

<p>The cheering still lacked the vim and heartiness which
Merriwell would like to have seen, but the Ophir fellows
had a long string of bitter defeats to live down, and
they were human, and the remembrance of their fights
with the rival club could not be wiped out in a minute.
It would take a good many friendly competitions, with
both sides showing consideration and forbearance, to
bring the relations of the clubs into the zone of true
sportsmanship. But that would come, Merriwell felt
certain, and to-day would mark the beginning.</p>

<p>It was one-thirty when Colonel Hawtrey rode into
camp. He had been notified by telephone that the game
was to be played, and he had come personally to help
inaugurate the “era of good feeling.” Mr. Bradlaugh had
also been notified, but business matters compelled him to
remain away from Tinaja Wells. He sent his regrets,
however, and warned the Ophir lads that he would expect
them to prove that they were true sportsmen in every
sense of the word.</p>

<p>The colonel was taken into camp with every expression
of good will. Not one in the Ophir crowd had any fault
to find with the big man from Gold Hill. For years he
had tried his utmost to smooth out the differences between
the rival clubs, but had found a mysterious influence
working against him and upsetting all his plans.
He had not the remotest idea that Jode Lenning was back
of this evil influence, but had he given some attention to
Jode he might have succeeded long before in bringing
affairs of the two clubs to a more amiable basis.</p>

<p>When two o’clock came, ten Gold Hill men came trotting
into the camp on the flat, Jode Lenning at their head.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_141">141</span>
The colonel, after greeting Jode, passed his eye over the
fellows behind him.</p>

<p>“Only ten!” he exclaimed. “What does this mean, my
boy?”</p>

<p>“Parkman was late in starting,” Jode answered, “and
we didn’t wait for him. He’ll be along soon.”</p>

<p>“Where’s Bleeker?”</p>

<p>“He has a grouch of some kind, colonel, and wouldn’t
come.” Lenning laughed good-naturedly. “He’ll get
over it, though,” he added. “You know how Bleek is!”</p>

<p>“I know he’s one of the best men on the team,” the
colonel remarked, “and that you’re handicapped without
him. You haven’t any substitutes.”</p>

<p>“We’re not going to need any, with this bunch.”</p>

<p>There was lofty contempt in Lenning’s voice. Here, at
the very start of the new schedule of friendly rivalry,
Lenning was giving vent to the spirit that had done so
much to put rival athletic affairs in a bad way.</p>

<p>“Tut, tut!” said the colonel, with a look of annoyance,
“these Ophir fellows are as fine a lot of players as I’ve
ever seen, and we’ll find that we’re up against a pretty
stiff proposition.”</p>

<p>Hooking his arm through Lenning’s, the colonel led him
off to one side and began talking with him in low and
earnest tones. Lenning could be seen to smile and put
on his most agreeable manner.</p>

<p>“Did you hear that, Chip?” Handy asked, in a husky
and angry whisper, of Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Never mind Lenning,” Frank answered. “Have the
fellows circulate among the visitors and show them there’s
no hard feelings. Because Lenning’s a cad, that’s no reason
the rest of the Gold Hill team are cut on the same
pattern.”</p>

<p>The Ophir lads went bravely at their task of inaugurat<span class="pagenum" id="Page_142">142</span>ing
a new spirit of friendliness with the other team. Going
among them, they drew them apart in groups, and
before long there was considerably less frost in the atmosphere
than there had been.</p>

<p>Presently the colonel and Lenning approached Merriwell
and Clancy. Lenning wore a furtive smile which
he no doubt intended to be genial and winning. He put
out his hand to Merry.</p>

<p>“Hello, Merriwell!” said he. “I’m sorry we had that
disagreement over the camping site. I was in the wrong
entirely. You see, I had my heart set on this place, and
when I learned that you Ophir fellows had it, it made
me mad. I acted like a fool, and that’s no lie. But we’ve
got a fine place, over at Camp Hawtrey, and I hope you
and the Ophir fellows will return this visit, and give us
a chance to convince you that we mean to be friends, and
all the better friends because we are rivals.”</p>

<p>Frank took the offered hand, passing it on to Clancy,
who came up at that moment.</p>

<p>“There’s no sense in being at loggerheads, Lenning,”
said Frank. “You may be sure that we’ll soon visit your
camp.”</p>

<p>Intuitively, Frank had felt that Jode Lenning’s clutching
fingers reflected anything but a genial nature. He
could not help but think that Lenning was acting a part,
and for Hawtrey’s exclusive benefit.</p>

<p>“I’m going to make it a point, my lads,” put in the
colonel jovially, “to be present at all your contests. And,”
he added, “I’m looking forward to a little wholesome excitement.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment Parkman, the straggler, arrived
in the camp. There was a queer expression on his face
as he sidled up toward Lenning, turning away suddenly
when he found the colonel’s eyes upon him.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_143">143</span></p>

<p>“Got here at last, eh, Parkman?” observed Hawtrey
pleasantly. “I suppose you were mending some of your
gear. It’s a good thing to overhaul your football equipment
occasionally and make sure that everything is in
proper trim for use.”</p>

<p>A blank look crossed Parkman’s face, but vanished
when he caught a significant glance from Lenning.</p>

<p>“That’s right, sir,” said Parkman, and walked away.</p>

<p>“I heard,” spoke up Lenning, “that Darrel met with
an accident yesterday. I—I hope it wasn’t serious?”</p>

<p>He threw a doubtful look at the colonel as he put the
question. The colonel seemed to be paying little attention
to what was said, and yet Frank felt sure that he
saw a glint of sudden anxiety rise in his eyes.</p>

<p>“Broken arm, that’s all,” replied Merry. “Darrel will
be all right in a few weeks.”</p>

<p>“You’d better take your crowd out for a little signal
practice, Jode,” suggested the colonel. “I’ll go with you.
It will soon be time for the game,” he finished, looking
at his watch.</p>

<p>“Good idea, sir,” assented Lenning; and called to the
Gold Hill players.</p>

<p>With the colonel at his side, Lenning led the way
toward the mesa. Parkman dodged along at their heels,
seeking a chance for a word in private with Lenning, but
finding none.</p>

<p>“Say, Chip,” said Clancy, when the Gold Hillers had
vanished over the edge of the mesa, “when I took Lenning’s
hand I felt as though I had a fistful of cold fish.
Allow me to repeat what I said before—that Lenning person
is strictly nig.”</p>

<p>“Let it go at that, Clan,” answered Merry. “The rest
of the Gold Hillers are all right.”</p>

<p>“It’s a hard job, making friends with that outfit,” said<span class="pagenum" id="Page_144">144</span>
Handy, coming up just then and mopping the sweat from
his face. “Everybody’s under a good deal of a strain,
and most of the Gold Hillers seem to be taking their cue
from Lenning. He’s a pill.”</p>

<p>“Sugar-coated,” grinned Clancy, “when the colonel’s
around.”</p>

<p>“He makes me sick,” grunted Handy bluntly. “We’ve
taken the colonel on for referee,” he continued, to Merriwell,
“by way of showing our good will. Let’s go up
on the mesa and get busy. I’ll be glad as blazes when
this game is over with.”</p>

<p>“Them’s my sentiments, too, old man,” added Clancy,
dropping in beside Merriwell as the Ophir team started
for the field.</p>

<p>Gold Hill won the toss. The wind was at its back,
and a Gold Hill toe lifted the ball far into the field.</p>

<p>The game was on. From the side lines, Merriwell and
Clancy were watching every move with keen, critical eyes.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_145">145</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXII" id="CHAPTER_XXII">CHAPTER XXII.</a><br />

<small>SHARP WORK.</small></h2>


<p>“The Gold Hillers shape up well, Chip,” remarked
Clancy. “So far as beef is concerned, they put it all over
our lads.”</p>

<p>“Headwork does more than ‘beef’ to win a game,
Clan,” replied Merriwell confidently. “Look at Brad,
will you!”</p>

<p>Hannibal Bradlaugh, playing half back for the Ophir
team, had caught the ball and run it back twenty yards
before he was downed. In another moment came the
first scrimmage. Neither Clancy nor Merry had any time
for further talk, just then, so anxious were they not to
miss a single detail of the play.</p>

<p>Brad tried to get through the center. He gained a
little, and Handy, captain and full back, went around
the end for a couple of yards. The Gold Hill line was
putting up a good defense, and both Merriwell and Clancy
were finding time to note the work of Lenning, at right
guard.</p>

<p>“Remember how he beat the pistol in the race with
Darrel?” Clancy said to Merriwell. “If Lenning was
tricky in one thing you’ll find him tricky in all. He’ll try
something or other here, if I’m any prophet, Chip.”</p>

<p>“Not while the colonel is watching him, Clan,” Merry
answered.</p>

<p>Handy retreated, and kicked. The colonel, carried
away by the game and perhaps forgetting that an impartial
spirit was to be looked for in a referee, was shouting
excitedly and urging the Gold Hillers to do their best,
and applauding their resistance.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_146">146</span></p>

<p>Merriwell was eager to learn whether the Ophir fellows
could hold the rival eleven as well as Gold Hill had
held their Ophir opponents. The players crouched, then,
as though touched by an electric wire, flung into action.
The result was a disappointment, for Gold Hill had gone
through the Ophir line for five yards.</p>

<p>The colonel’s excitement increased. He was cheering
his club frantically when he suddenly seemed to remember
his official position, and put a damper on his ardor.</p>

<p>“Hold them, Ophir!” whooped Clancy. “You’re just
as good as they are! Aren’t you going to hold ’em?”</p>

<p>This urging seemed to have no effect, for there was
another play, and this time the ball went through for a
seven-yard gain.</p>

<p>“Well, well!” muttered Merry. “What do you think
of that?”</p>

<p>There followed a fierce drive at center, and Joe Mayburn
let the runner get past him for ten yards. Clancy
was dancing around like a wild man. Handy was doing
all he could to steady the boys, but it was plain that
they were badly rattled by the sharp work of the other
team.</p>

<p>Another play was aimed at center, but Mayburn was
on his mettle, and the attack was thrown off.</p>

<p>“Bully work, Mayburn!” roared Merry. “That’s the
style!”</p>

<p>“I guess they don’t find Mayburn so easy as they
thought,” chuckled Clancy. “There they go again,” he
added.</p>

<p>And again Gold Hill failed. Confidence was returning
to the Ophir men.</p>

<p>“They’re getting their nerve back,” commented Merriwell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_147">147</span>
“Oh, I guess we’ll show those fellows that Ophir
is a different crowd to-day from what it was a year ago.
Now let Gold Hill kick.”</p>

<p>The way Ophir came up the field was beautiful to see.
Savagely Gold Hill fought for every yard of the way.
After two downs and a total gain of twenty yards, Handy
tried for a field goal and missed. The colonel waved
his hat, and then calmed himself into the correct official
impassiveness. A little later, he blew the whistle.</p>

<p>“Fifteen minutes?” cried Clancy. “Thunder, Chip, it
seems more like fifteen seconds to me.”</p>

<p>“The colonel’s holding the watch,” laughed Merry, “so
he must have it pretty nearly right.”</p>

<p>“We ought to have a full sixty-minute session out of
this. Why the deuce did Handy stipulate that only two
quarters were to be played?”</p>

<p>“His head was level. A little of this sort of thing is
a great plenty—with the real game some three weeks off.”</p>

<p>Parkman moved over toward Lenning, who was walking
from the field. The two sat down to rest on a heap
of bowlders close to the edge of the mesa.</p>

<p>The colonel, his face beaming, made directly for Merriwell
and Clancy.</p>

<p>“It’s as even a thing, Merriwell,” he exclaimed, “as
you’d find anywhere! You’ve done wonders with this
Ophir eleven. If I wasn’t so old and warped with rheumatism
I’d take a hand in it myself. Why don’t you get
into it?”</p>

<p>The colonel did not wait for an answer, but saw Handy
coming up and turned in his direction.</p>

<p>“I’d like an hour of this, Handy,” he cried. “Why
don’t you let ’em box the compass for the limit?”</p>

<p>Handy looked at Merriwell, and what he saw in the
latter’s face convinced him that his stipulations were
fully approved.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_148">148</span></p>

<p>“I don’t want to work our boys too hard, just at the
present time, colonel,” said he. “The first quarter ended
with the ball in the center of the field, and with everything
pretty well balanced, so far as I could make out.”</p>

<p>Merriwell, seeing Bradlaugh beckon to him, left Clancy
and Handy talking with the colonel, and moved over to
hear what Brad had to say.</p>

<p>“Chip,” whispered Brad excitedly, “there’s a hen on!”</p>

<p>“What do you mean?”</p>

<p>“I mean that Lenning is up to some dirty move or
other, that’s what I mean.”</p>

<p>“Bosh! I’ve been watching him like a weasel, and
I——”</p>

<p>“I don’t mean during the play,” Brad interrupted, “but
over there on that rock pile where he’s been talking with
Parkman.”</p>

<p>“What’s happened?”</p>

<p>“I was over there myself, stretched out for a little rest.
I was on one side of the bowlders, and those two came
up and sat on the other side. Parkman handed Lenning
something. ‘That’s from Bleeker,’ I heard him say,
‘and he says it contains some hot news about Darrel and
Merriwell.’ That’s all that was said. Parkman sneaked
off as though he was afraid some one would see him. I
got up to move away, and looked back, to see Lenning
reading a note. His face was savage. He made as
though he’d tear up the note, then changed his mind and
pushed it in between the lacings of his jacket. What do
you suppose is going on?”</p>

<p>“Whatever it is, Brad,” answered Merriwell calmly,
“it’s none of my business.”</p>

<p>“But Parkman mentioned your name and Darrel’s.
Certainly it is some of your business.”</p>

<p>“I can’t figure it that way, or——”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_149">149</span></p>

<p>Merriwell bit his words short. Ballard was just hurrying
up over the edge of the mesa and laying a course
in his direction. Merry’s first thought was that something
had happened to Darrel, and he hastened to get
close to Ballard.</p>

<p>“Game begun?” panted Ballard.</p>

<p>“Begun, and half over,” was the reply. “We’re only
to play two quarters, and there’s a fifteen-minute interval
between them. What’s the matter, Pink? Why are you
here? Darrel all right?”</p>

<p>“Darrel’s getting along in good shape,” Ballard answered,
“but there’s something up that ought to be attended
to.”</p>

<p>“What?”</p>

<p>“It seems there’s a division of sentiment in the Gold
Hill camp regarding Darrel. A few of the Gold Hill fellows
think Darrel isn’t getting a fair shake. Lenning
found it out, and made them stay behind when he and
the rest came to Tinaja Wells for this game. He’d had
a quarrel with Bleeker, I don’t know what about, and the
two have hardly spoken since last night. Hotchkiss, one
of Darrel’s Gold Hill friends, came to Dolliver’s a while
ago and said Bleeker had given Parkman a letter to be
delivered to Lenning, and that the letter contains evidence
that will clear Darrel of that forgery charge.”</p>

<p>Merriwell jumped. Bradlaugh, too, was wildly excited.</p>

<p>“Jupiter!” muttered Brad, “I reckon we’re getting this
down pretty fine.”</p>

<p>“How do you know the letter contains evidence of that
sort?” asked Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Hotchkiss said so.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_150">150</span></p>
<p>“Well, how does Hotchkiss know?”</p>

<p>“He and one or two more of Darrel’s friends at Camp
Hawtrey got their heads together and figured it out.
Hotchkiss rode over to Dolliver’s to tell Darrel that some
of his friends must get the letter away from Parkman.”</p>

<p>“Parkman has already delivered it,” put in Brad.</p>

<p>“Then, Hotchkiss said, it’s got to be taken away from
Lenning.”</p>

<p>Merriwell’s dark eyes flashed. He believed fully in
Darrel, and he had no confidence whatever in Lenning.
In his own mind, Merry was convinced that Lenning had
fabricated, and carried into effect, that dastardly plot to
make it appear as though Darrel had looted the colonel’s
safe of the one thousand dollars.</p>

<p>Was it possible that here, during this brief try-out
with Gold Hill, evidence could be deduced proving Darrel
innocent of that forgery charge?</p>

<p>Ballard, in his excitement, had not stated the case exactly
as it was. Hotchkiss had qualified his assertions
somewhat in saying that the communication from Bleeker
to Lenning contained forgery evidence. Ballard had
merely left out the qualifying words of the friend of Darrel
from Camp Hawtrey.</p>

<p>This, at first blush, might seem like a trifling omission,
and yet had Merriwell not believed absolutely that Hotchkiss
knew what he was talking about, and that the note
really contained evidence in the forgery matter, his action
would have been vastly different from what it was.</p>

<p>It would soon be time to put the ball into play again.
Merriwell, his eyes roving over the field and the scattered
players, was thinking deeply.</p>

<p>“You think, Brad,” he asked, “that Lenning still has
that note where you say he placed it?”</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch!” Brad declared.</p>

<p>“Keep this under your hats, both of you,” said Mer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_151">151</span>riwell.
“If that evidence concerns Darrel, and indirectly
myself, we’re going to have it.”</p>

<p>He spun around and ran back to the field. Lenning
was right guard for the Gold Hill team, and Spencer
Dunn was left guard for Ophir.</p>

<p>“Spence,” said Merry, “I want some of your harness.
If you’ve no objection, I’d like to take your place in the
game for the second quarter.”</p>

<p>“Go to it, Chip!” answered Dunn cheerfully, and began
shedding as much of his costume as Merriwell thought
necessary and had time to take.</p>

<p>Colonel Hawtrey witnessed the proceeding.</p>

<p>“Couldn’t stand the strain, eh, Merriwell?” he laughed.
“Well, I don’t blame you, my boy. Now I expect to see
some real football.”</p>

<p>Merriwell smiled a little. “I wonder what Hawtrey
would say,” he muttered to himself,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_152">152</span> “if he knew just
what sort of a game within a game this was going to be?”</p>

<small>GETTING THE EVIDENCE.</small></h2>


<p>Merriwell was not disposed to be at all considerate of
Jode Lenning. Into Merry’s mind, again, came those
ugly suspicions of the favorite nephew.</p>

<p>It was conceivable that Lenning, jealous of his half
brother, had plotted to have him cast off and set adrift,
just as he had, Merriwell felt sure, engineered that robbery
plot against him. What had caused the accident
on the cliff still remained a mystery; yet, terrible as that
accident had been, if the result of a plot, then the plot
was less heinous than the one by which it had been made
to appear that Ellis Darrel was a forger. Through the
first, life might have been lost; but, through the second,
honor, which men of integrity hold dearer than life, hung
in the balance.</p>

<p>The blood ran hot through Merriwell’s veins as all
these thoughts trooped through his mind. Here was a
chance to do something for Darrel, was the idea that
filled him, to the exclusion of anything and everything
else.</p>

<p>Taking his place on the field, opposite Lenning, Merriwell
strove to note the exact place where the note from
Bleeker had been stowed. His eyes, peering hawklike
from either side of the rubber nose guard, sought the
lacings of the other guard’s jacket. Between two of the
crossed thongs he believed he caught a flash, the merest
flash, of something white. Then, while Merriwell’s brain
was still lashed with those ugly suspicions of Lenning,
the playing began.</p>

<p>Ophir ran the kick-off back a bare seven yards. Line
plunges, during which Merry sought in vain for a chance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_153">153</span>
at that scrap of white, netted another gain of four yards.
Then, as in some weird dream, Merriwell found himself
crouching in the middle of the line, staring into the face
of Lenning, with its shifty eyes and its overtopping mop
of black hair. The swaying lines locked and clashed
as the ball flew out of the scramble and into the arms
of the Gold Hill half back.</p>

<p>Merry plunged forward in an attempt to break through.
Lenning threw out a leg to trip him. Merry’s hands
pawed at the jacket as he went down, but he was up again
in a flash with something clutched in his fist.</p>

<p>“You’re not so much!” snarled Lenning.</p>

<p>Merriwell laughed. He could afford to. The evidence
was in his possession now.</p>

<p>The playing went on, and gradually Merriwell began to
take more interest in the battle and less in the scrap of
evidence which had come into his hands.</p>

<p>Ophir had the ball and was going down the field with
it, five yards through tackle, five more stolen through the
guard, and then five more around the end. A tackle run
netted ten yards, and a forward pass twenty, Brad grabbing
the ball on a perfect throw.</p>

<p>Gold Hill’s confidence was oozing away steadily. Her
men were rattled, and Clancy and Dunn and Ballard
were doing their utmost from the side lines to make their
confusion more complete. Before Ophir’s attack, the
Gold Hill line slumped and gave way.</p>

<p>And then, when close to Gold Hill’s goal, Mayburn lost
the ball on a distressing fumble. That nearly broke the
center’s heart. Hawtrey hung over the scramble as the
players disentangled themselves, and it was discovered
that a Gold Hill man had the ball.</p>

<p>“Somebody kick me!” wailed Mayburn.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_154">154</span> “Oh, what a
bobble!”</p>

<p>Gold Hill had no use for a scrimmage at that stage of
the game, and immediately lifted the pigskin into safer
quarters. Both sides were still without a score when, a
few minutes later, the quarter ended.</p>

<p>Merriwell had smothered his desire to do his best.
Ophir, he knew, had outplayed Gold Hill, and it was
better for all concerned that there should be no scoring.
On the face of it, the teams might be called evenly
matched. As for the rest of it, the game Merriwell had
played within the game had been entirely successful.</p>

<p>The best of good feeling prevailed. It was much easier
for the right spirit to manifest itself over a scoreless
game than if one side or the other had made a touchdown
or had kicked a goal.</p>

<p>Led by the colonel, the Gold Hill fellows collected in
a group and cheered the Ophir team, while Ophir, with
Handy and Merriwell leading, returned the compliment
for their opponents.</p>

<p>“This,” beamed the colonel, taking Merriwell and
Handy off to one side, “starts our series of friendly competitions,
and leaves nothing to be desired. I have enjoyed
myself this afternoon, and it has been a pleasure
to me to notice the utter absence of anything like ill feeling.
Keep up the good work, boys. I’ll have to leave
you now, for I want to get on my horse and ride over
to the other camp. Jode and his teammates will make the
trip ’cross country.”</p>

<p>Merriwell and Handy walked with the colonel to the
camp. As he was about to mount his horse for the
ride to Camp Hawtrey, the colonel turned and gave Merry
his hand.</p>

<p>“I wish that some day you might come to town with
Jode and have dinner with me,” said he.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_155">155</span> “I should esteem
it a great pleasure, Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Thank you, colonel,” Frank answered, “but I’m
afraid I shall be too busy here to accept many social
invitations.”</p>

<p>“You won’t forget to take the Ophir boys over to the
other camp?”</p>

<p>“They can look for us over there almost any day.”</p>

<p>“Good!”</p>

<p>He swung into his saddle, waved his hand, and started
at a gallop down the gulch.</p>

<p>“We could have scored,” mourned Handy, “we ought to
have scored. Mayburn——”</p>

<p>“I’m glad he fumbled,” interrupted Frank. “As I told
the boys before they went on the field, I wasn’t eager to
have them win, but I was more than eager to have them
keep Gold Hill from winning. We outplayed them, and
that’s enough.”</p>

<p>“You got into it yourself in order to study the other
team at close quarters?”</p>

<p>“That wasn’t my idea exactly,” Frank answered, “although
the experience will probably be a help. Come on,”
he added, suddenly shifting the subject, “and let’s take
our plunge in the pool.”</p>

<p>Ballard and Bradlaugh were feverishly eager to have
a few words in private with Merriwell. The opportunity
did not offer until some time after Merriwell had had
his swim and had got into his clothes; then, as he walked
toward the camp, Ballard and Bradlaugh and Clancy
joined him. Already Ballard had confided to Clancy,
Merriwell’s real reason for getting actively into the football
game.</p>

<p>“Did you win out, Chip?” asked Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>Merriwell nodded, and slapped his pocket.</p>

<p>“What’s the evidence?” queried Ballard.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_156">156</span> “Does it clear
Darrel?”</p>

<p>“Haven’t looked at it yet,” was the reply.</p>

<p>Astonished exclamations came from the other three.</p>

<p>“Don’t mean to say you haven’t had time?” Clancy
asked.</p>

<p>“I’ve had the time, Clan, but not the inclination. We’ll
let Darrel look at the note first. Maybe,” and Merry
grew thoughtful, “I jumped into this thing too quick.
Suppose Hotchkiss was wrong? Suppose there’s no evidence
in the note about the forgery? If that’s the case,
I’ve done a measly trick.”</p>

<p>“You were justified in getting that note, Chip,” declared
Ballard, “just on the strength of what I told you.”</p>

<p>“I hope so,” said Frank, “but that’s a thing we’ll leave
to Darrel. Shall we ride down the cañon this afternoon?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got to go back,” returned Ballard, “and you fellows
might as well go with me.”</p>

<p>Without delay, they started to get their horses ready.
Half an hour later they were speeding along the narrow
cañon trail in single file, Merriwell hardly knowing
whether he ought to feel elated or depressed over his
exploit on the football field.</p>

<p>The high ideas of honor, inculcated by his father,
would not have pardoned his afternoon’s work unless it
set right the great wrong that had been done Ellis Darrel.
Merriwell felt that, in his eagerness to help his
new chum, he might have committed a deed which he
would later regret. He had acted on the impulse of the
moment, and with implicit faith in what Ballard had repeated
as coming from Hotchkiss.</p>

<p>A fine point of ethics was involved, and Merriwell
believed that no eyes save Darrel’s should read the note
unless it was really found to have an important bearing
on Darrel’s affairs.</p>

<small>CONCERNING THE EVIDENCE.</small></h2>


<p>When the four lads reached Dolliver’s, they found Darrel
anxiously awaiting news from Tinaja Wells.</p>

<p>“Did you get that letter, pards?” were his first words,
as the four from the camp trooped into the house.</p>

<p>“Yes,” said Frank. “Parkman had delivered the letter
to Lenning, and Lenning was in a temper when he read
it. He seemed on the point of tearing the note in pieces,
then changed his mind and pushed it into the front of
his jacket. Brad saw him.”</p>

<p>“How did you get it from Lenning?”</p>

<p>“During the football game. I got into the play and
secured the note in a scrimmage.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said Darrel, with deep feeling, “you’re a
loyal friend, if a fellow ever had one.”</p>

<p>“It’s something I wouldn’t have done unless it seemed
best,” answered Merriwell, “and I wouldn’t have done it,
Darrel, if I had thought there was the slightest doubt that
it’s not what Hotchkiss said.”</p>

<p>“Hasn’t it anything to do with me, or—or that trouble
with the colonel?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what the letter contains. I have brought
it to you, Darrel, and you can read it. If it hasn’t any
bearing on you, I’m going to take it back to Lenning and
tell him how I got it.”</p>

<p>Clancy and Ballard were about to cry out against such
a proceeding, but there was a look in their chum’s face
which assured them that he had made up his mind as to
the course he should follow, and would keep to it if the
circumstances warranted.
<span class="pagenum" id="Page_158">158</span></p>

<p>“Let’s see the letter, Chip,” said Darrel huskily.</p>

<p>Merriwell removed the soiled and crumpled paper from
his pocket and silently handed it to Darrel. The latter’s
hand trembled as he took the folded scrap and slowly
opened it. His eyes widened as he read the note’s contents;
and then, when he had finished, his hand dropped
nervelessly at his side and he stared at Merriwell with
wide eyes.</p>

<p>“What is it?” asked Merry. “Has it anything to do
with you?”</p>

<p>“Yes,” was the muffled response, “and with you, too.
Read it. I think you have a perfect right to do so,
Chip.”</p>

<p>Merry took the note and read as follows:</p>

<blockquote>

<p>“<span class="smcap">Lenning</span>: I know about your cutting the rope and
dropping Darrel down the cliff. There are some things
I won’t stand for, and that’s one of them. If you try any
dirty work during the football game, I’ll blow the whole
measly business to Merriwell.</p>

<p class="psig right"><span class="smcap">Bleeker.</span>”</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Merriwell gasped. There was no further doubt about
that supposed accident on the cliff. It was no accident
at all, but the result of a fiendish design. It seemed
hardly possible that Lenning, if in his right senses, could
have attempted such a villainous deed.</p>

<p>Without a word, Frank handed the note to Clancy, and
it went from one to the other until all had read it. No
one spoke. The crumpled paper came back to Darrel
again, and he held it thoughtfully in his trembling fingers.</p>

<p>Distant voices were heard outside the house. Through
a window beside his bed Darrel could look into the mouth
of the cañon.</p>

<p>Two horsemen had ridden out of the ragged entrance of
the gulch and had halted, their mounts pulled close to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_159">159</span>gether.
One of the riders was Colonel Hawtrey and the
other was Lenning.</p>

<p>The colonel, it was evident, was on his way back to
Gold Hill after visiting the camp of the Gold Hill Athletic
Club. Lenning, it was equally evident, had ridden
part way with him, and was now about to face the
other way and return to the camp.</p>

<p>Through the window, all the boys in the ranch house
looked at the horsemen. The colonel was smiling and
happy. On his face could be seen a look of affection for
the lad at his side. Taking Jode’s hand, he pressed it
warmly, then used his spurs and rode off along the trail
toward home.</p>

<p>Jode watched him for a few moments, shouted a last
farewell, waved his hat, and then vanished at a gallop
between the rugged cañon walls. A mist arose in the
eyes of Ellis Darrel. He began tearing the paper to
pieces, using his teeth and the one hand which was still
serviceable.</p>

<p>“What are you doing that for, Darrel?” demanded
Ballard.</p>

<p>“It would kill my uncle if he thought both his nephews
were scoundrels,” Darrel answered. “I can’t have a hand
in blackening Jode’s character like this. I’ve put up with
a whole lot, and I can put up with a good deal more than
I have, but this fight of mine is to prove that I didn’t
sign the colonel’s name to a check. See what I mean?
I—I can’t kill the colonel’s faith in Jode—not in this way.
Don’t say a word about this, any of you. Promise me
that you won’t.”</p>

<p>There was something fine and noble about Darrel’s act
in destroying the evidence against Jode. It was not the
evidence that Darrel wanted. The temptation to ruin his
half brother was not so strong as his love for the mis<span class="pagenum" id="Page_160">160</span>guided
old colonel, or his desire to prove his own innocence.</p>

<p>Merriwell stepped to the bed and clasped Darrel’s hand.</p>

<p>“That’s right, old man,” said he, “exactly right. Say,
Darrel,” and his voice quivered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_161">161</span> “you’re a brick!”</p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXV" id="CHAPTER_XXV">CHAPTER XXV.</a><br />

<small>THE UNDER DOG.</small></h2>


<p>“Great Scott, Chip! Say, I didn’t think there was
a place like that in Arizona.”</p>

<p>Young Merriwell and his red-headed chum, Owen
Clancy, stood on the crest of the long, sloping wall of a
gulch and looked downward at a scene that filled them
with wonder and admiration.</p>

<p>The gulch was perhaps a hundred and fifty feet deep,
and a quarter of a mile from rim to rim. On either
side the slopes fell away in a gentle descent, sparsely covered
with pine trees, and with here and there a patch
of flaming poppies touching the brown of the hillsides as
with fire.</p>

<p>In the depths was a long, silvery vista of water, placid,
and cool, and deep. At the foot of the slope on whose
crest the two lads were standing, was a wide strip of
clean yellow sand. Here there were half a dozen white
canvas tents, pitched close to the water, with camping
equipment scattered in all directions.</p>

<p>Four or five canoes were drawn up on the beach. On
a float, a few yards from shore, several lads in “Nature’s
raiment” were sitting and splashing their feet in the
water; others were diving from the float, their white
bodies flashing outward and downward like so many
darts, disappearing under the smooth surface of the
river and leaving a jet of spray and a quiver of silvery
ripples; and still others were swimming, far up and
down the stream. All were enjoying themselves to the
utmost, if their laughter, echoing and reverberating between
the slopes could be taken as an indication.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_162">162</span></p>

<p>“This is certainly a peach of a place for a camp,” said
young Merriwell. “In some ways it has our own camp
at Tinaja Wells beaten a mile. The sight of those canoes
down there makes me hungry for a paddle!”</p>

<p>“And to think,” went on Clancy, “that this is nearly
the middle of November, and that back home the snow
is beginning to fly, and overcoats are trumps, and folks
are hunting up their galoshes! Wow! It hardly seems
possible. Down here in southern Arizona a fellow can
have his out-door sports all the year ’round. So that’s
Camp Hawtrey, eh? Well, it’s a bully place, if you ask
me.”</p>

<p>“The only thing these Gold Hill fellows haven’t got
is a good athletic field. I hear they’ve cleaned up a
patch of desert back of the gulch, and are using that for
sports and practice. But that slice of raw ground isn’t
in it with our mesa, Clan.”</p>

<p>“You’re right there, Chip. Our camp at Tinaja Wells
has certainly got it over this one so far as a field is
concerned, but I wish we had a nice stretch of river
like that for canoeing. Where’s Lenning? Can you see
him down there in that bunch of swimmers?”</p>

<p>The boys above studied carefully the ones below, but
failed to discover Lenning.</p>

<p>“He’s not there, Clan,” said Merriwell, “and I can’t
see Bleeker, Hotchkiss, and several more of the Gold
Hill Athletic Club whom we know tolerably well.”</p>

<p>“Jode Lenning, I guess, is the main squeeze of that
outfit, and he’s the one we’ll have to talk with.”</p>

<p>“I hate to have anything to do with him,” muttered
Merry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_163">163</span> “but he’s Colonel Hawtrey’s nephew, and the
colonel is the backbone of the Gold Hill club, and if our
fellows and the Gold Hillers have any more friendly
competitions, we’ll have to arrange with Lenning.”</p>

<p>“Lenning’s a skunk,” growled Clancy. “If it hadn’t
been for him we know mighty well that Ellis Darrel, his
own half brother, wouldn’t be laid up at Dolliver’s with
a broken arm. We know, I say, that Lenning cut the
rope that dropped Darrel over the cliff, and——”</p>

<p>“Cut it, Clan!” interrupted Merriwell. “We promised
Darrel we’d keep that to ourselves.”</p>

<p>“Well, I’m not blowing it around, am I? The way
Hawtrey snuggles up to Lenning and hands Darrel, his
other nephew, all the hard knocks makes me pretty darn
tired.”</p>

<p>“Hawtrey will be all right when he finds out that Darrel
didn’t forge his name to that check more than a
year ago.”</p>

<p>“Yes, <em>when</em> he finds it out—and that’s never. Lenning,
I’ll bet a peck of dollars, was at the bottom of that
forgery, and you can’t bring forward any proof against
Lenning that the colonel will consider. You know that
as well as I do, Chip.”</p>

<p>“Something will turn up, Clan,” asserted Merriwell
confidently. “When a fellow gets in wrong it’s bound
to come out unless he changes his ways. And Jode
Lenning isn’t changing—that is, not so you can notice
it. Luck is going to turn Darrel’s way—I’ve got a pretty
good hunch to that effect. The old colonel will find out
for himself just which of his nephews is the more reliable.
Wait, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“I can’t see anything rosy in Darrel’s future,” growled
Clancy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_164">164</span> “so long as Jode has his big stand-in with his
Uncle Alvah. But there’s no use chinning about that
now. We’re over here from our camp as a games committee
to fix up a schedule of sports with Gold Hill, and
we’re supposed to be loaded to the gunnels with peaceable
sentiments and loving regards for Ophir’s athletic
rivals. Oh, slush! I’m in such an amiable mood, right
this minute, that I’d like to take a crack at Lenning with
my bare knuckles.”</p>

<p>“Lenning’s only one of that Gold Hill crowd, old
man,” said Chip soothingly. “Bradlaugh, president of
the Ophir club, and Hawtrey, who backs the Gold Hillers,
are both tired of having the rival organizations at loggerheads.
They want peace and friendship between the two
camps, and I don’t blame them. We’re going to do
what we can to make the rivalry more sportsmanlike, and
less bitter. ‘Fair play and no favor,’ that’s our motto.
When we find Lenning, Clan, just hold yourself in and
don’t bite.”</p>

<p>“All right,” assented Clancy, although with a show
of some reluctance. “Let’s go down there, find Lenning,
and get the business over with.”</p>

<p>Before they could start down the long slope that led
to the bottom of the gulch, both lads were suddenly
startled by the sudden note of a firearm. The report
came from a considerable distance, evidently, yet was
perfectly clear and distinct.</p>

<p>“What’s that?” demanded Clancy, wheeling about and
staring at his chum.</p>

<p>“Sounded like a revolver,” was the reply. “Somebody
trying a hand at target practice, more than likely.”</p>

<p>“The sound didn’t come from below—the shooting is
going on up here, somewhere. Maybe Lenning is mixed
up in it.”</p>

<p>“We’ll mosey around and find out,” said Merry.</p>

<p>Another report was heard, and the two chums, laying
their course by the sound, started along the top of the
gulch wall. A third shot was followed by a sharp yelp,
as of some animal in pain.</p>

<p>“Was that a dog, Chip?” queried Clancy.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_165">165</span></p>

<p>“Strikes me it was,” said Merry. “This way,” he
added, turning from the gulch and moving off into some
low, rocky hills.</p>

<p>As they advanced, the boys heard voices and laughter.
One of the voices they recognized as Jode Lenning’s.
Presently, from behind a bit of a ridge, they looked
out and discovered what was going on.</p>

<p>Lenning and three more of the Gold Hill crowd—fellows
of about his same stamp—had tied a dog to an ironwood
tree. At a distance of about fifty feet they were
taking turns shooting at the poor brute—evidently seeing
how close they could come without making a hit.</p>

<p>The dog was about as homely an animal as Merry had
ever seen. His tawny hide was scarred in a dozen different
places, and one eye was gone and a front leg was
crooked—apparently the leg had been broken and Nature
had healed it alone. There was some object tied to the
dog’s tail by a section of stout twine—the lads behind
the ridge could not make out exactly what the object
was.</p>

<p><em>Bang!</em> went the revolver. A flurry of dust was kicked
up under the wretched brute, which almost turned a
somersault at the end of the rope. Lenning and his companions
laughed at the dog’s antics.</p>

<p>Clancy’s face went black as a thundercloud. His fists
clenched and, with a muttered imprecation, he started to
hurl himself around the end of the ridge. Chip caught
him and held him back.</p>

<p>“Are you going to stand for this, Chip?” asked the red-headed
fellow in a savage whisper.</p>

<p>“No,” said Merriwell; “we’ll interfere at the right
time. Wait a minute.”</p>

<p>Clancy restrained himself and once more sank down<span class="pagenum" id="Page_166">166</span>
behind the rocks. Parkman, one of Lenning’s companions,
had begun to speak.</p>

<p>“I reckon we’d better stop shooting, Jode,” said he,
“or the dog will hit the cap on the stones and set off
the dynamite.”</p>

<p>“You’re right, Park,” answered Lenning. “We’ll pass
up the shooting, touch off the fuse, and set the ki-yi
adrift. When the cartridge goes off,” he chuckled, “I
bet there won’t be enough of that tramp dog left to
wad a gun. Lamson, you light the fuse. You can cut
the rope, Park, when the fuse is going. Be quick about
it or the whelp will take a piece out of you.”</p>

<p>Clancy’s eyes were fairly burning as he leaned toward
Merry and gripped his arm.</p>

<p>“Do you know what those skunks are up to, Chip?”
he whispered. “They’ve tied a dynamite cartridge to
that brute’s tail, and they’re going to light the fuse and
turn the dog loose!”</p>

<p>“No, they’re not,” said Merriwell decisively. “That’s
what they’re aiming to do, Clan, but we’ll interfere with
the game. They’re a fine crowd of cannibals, I must
say,” he went on scathingly. “The colonel ought to be
here and see that precious nephew of his in his real
colors. Hang it, Clan, I’m so worked up I can’t see
straight.”</p>

<p>Clancy gave vent to a gruesome laugh.</p>

<p>“Here we come from Tinaja Wells with an olive
branch,” he chuckled, “and now we’re going out to lam
Jode over the head with it. Come on. Lamson is getting
ready to scratch a match and light the fuse.”</p>

<p>“Here we go,” answered Merriwell.</p>

<p>With a rush the two boys got out from behind the
ridge. They were nearer the cowering dog than they
were to Lenning, and, the first thing Lamson knew, Mer<span class="pagenum" id="Page_167">167</span>riwell
had tipped him over and knocked the blazing
match from his fingers. Clancy, at the same time, had
grabbed Parkman by the collar and pulled him back so
quickly that the open jackknife fell out of his nerveless
hand.</p>

<p>Jode Lenning, stunned into momentary inaction by the
unexpected appearance of Merriwell and Clancy, suddenly
recovered himself, gave an angry yell, and started
toward the newcomers at a run.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXVI">CHAPTER XXVI.</a><br />

<small>BAD BLOOD.</small></h2>


<p>As the only heir of a very rich and influential man,
Jode Lenning had a number of followers of a certain
sort. Parkham, Lamson, and “Klink” Hummer, who
were bearing a part with Jode in his doubtful “sport”
with the tramp dog, were three of these satellites; and
they revolved around Jode and made his will their law,
just for the favors which he could dole out to them.
There was a community of interest among the four
lads, but no real friendship.</p>

<p>As Lenning rushed toward Merriwell and Clancy,
Hummer raced along at his heels. Finally the two halted
close to the pair from the other camp. Lamson and
Parkman, scowling over the rough treatment they had
received, had regained their feet and stepped shoulder to
shoulder with Lenning.</p>

<p>“What are you two butting in here for?” shouted Lenning,
his shifty eyes a-gleam with anger.</p>

<p>“We think you’ve tortured that dog enough, Lenning,”
replied Merriwell, smothering his own wrath and trying
to use a persuasive tone. “You’d better cut away that
dynamite cartridge and let the brute go.”</p>

<p>Here was a suggestion that thinly veiled a command.
Although Merriwell’s voice was like velvet, yet it cut
like steel, and Lenning’s temper boiled more briskly than
ever.</p>

<p>“You’re a private little society for the prevention of
cruelty to coyote dogs, eh?” Lenning sneered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_169">169</span> “That
cur has been snooping around our camp for days, stealing
our grub. We’re going to put him out of business,
and you chumps can’t come crow-hopping around here
and meddle with our plans.”</p>

<p>“There are other ways of putting a dog out of business,”
said Frank, “than singeing him with bullets and
then blowing him up with dynamite.”</p>

<p>“It’s none o’ your put-in,” scowled Lamson, rubbing a
blister on his hand where the match had burned him.</p>

<p>“I reckon we can do as we blame’ please in our own
camp,” said Hummer.</p>

<p>Merriwell, stepping to the cowering brute, bent over to
remove the string from his stump of a tail.</p>

<p>“Keep away from that dog, Merriwell!” stormed Lenning,
taking a couple of threatening steps in Frank’s
direction.</p>

<p>Clancy promptly jumped in front of Lenning.</p>

<p>“That will be far enough,” he said curtly. “Go on,
Chip,” he added to Frank. “I’ll look after this duffer.”</p>

<p>The words were hardly out of Clancy’s mouth before
Lenning struck him. The blow caught the red-headed
chap in the shoulder and spun him half around. The
next instant Clancy was going for Lenning, hammer and
tongs. Before Lamson, Hummer, or Parkman could
interfere, a stiff right-hander had put Lenning on his
knees.</p>

<p>“That’s enough of that kind of work!” cried Merriwell,
leaping up and tossing the dynamite cartridge into
the bushes. “We didn’t come here to kick up a row.
Hands off, you fellows!” he ordered, facing Lenning’s
restive comrades.</p>

<p>“Go for ’em!” whooped Lenning, nursing a bruised
chin with both hands.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_170">170</span> “If they want a rough-house, give
’em a-plenty. There are only two of them and three of
you. What are you hanging back for?”</p>

<p>Probably Lamson, Hummer, and Parkman had no
great amount of courage, and Merriwell and Clancy
looked rather formidable to them. Be that as it may,
yet when Lenning had dropped to his knees his three
companions had held back.</p>

<p>Now, under their leader’s urging, Hummer threw himself
toward Frank. The latter side-stepped a savage
blow and turned suddenly to put out a foot and trip
Lamson, who was making a headlong rush at him from
the side. Lamson fell sprawling into Hummer, and
both dropped in a tangle. Clancy laughed.</p>

<p>“A little ground and lofty tumbling by Lamson and
Hummer,” he remarked. “Why don’t you get up, Jode,
and take a hand in this set-to yourself? Where’s your
ginger? You’re not going to leave all this to your
friends, are you?”</p>

<p>“Just a minute,” put in Frank, as Lenning, muttering
wrathfully, struggled erect. “This thing can stop right
where it is. Clancy and I don’t want to stir up any
hard feelings. We came over from our camp this afternoon
to arrange for a competition of some kind with
you Gold Hill chaps. Now, let’s drop this and——”</p>

<p>“I’ll drop that red-headed freak over there,” cut in
Lenning, “if it’s the last thing I ever do! Who wants
any competitions with that Ophir bunch of yaps? All
we want you fellows to do is to stay away from Camp
Hawtrey and leave us alone.”</p>

<p>He was edging slowly toward Clancy, his face contorted
with rage. Lenning wasn’t a pleasant sight, and
Frank wondered how a fellow could give away to his
temper in such fashion.</p>

<p>“That will do you, Lenning!” said he sternly. “Keep
your shirt on—if you don’t want to get more than you
bargain for.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_171">171</span></p>

<p>The glint in Clancy’s eyes meant trouble, and Frank
knew that his red-headed chum would go the limit with
Lenning if the latter got close enough for a fight. At
this stage of the affair, when a one-sided scrimmage
seemed inevitable, Bleeker and Hotchkiss, of the Gold
Hill crowd, stepped out from behind a pile of rocks
and rapidly approached the scenes. Hotchkiss, on his
way, halted to cut the dog adrift, and the harassed brute
vanished among the low hills like a streak.</p>

<p>“This will be fine news for Colonel Hawtrey!” exclaimed
Bleeker, coming close to his camp mates. “He’ll
be tickled to death when he hears about this—I don’t
think. You must be going bug house, Jode!”</p>

<p>Lenning whirled on Bleeker like a fury.</p>

<p>“Get away from here!” he flashed. “You’re a cheap
skate, anyhow, and I reckon you know pretty well what
I think of <em>you</em>!”</p>

<p>“I reckon I do,” returned Bleeker slowly. “We’ve
hardly been on speaking terms for a week.”</p>

<p>“You attend to your own business,” snapped Lenning,
“and I’ll take care of mine.”</p>

<p>“There’ll be no more fighting with Merriwell and
Clancy,” asserted Bleeker firmly. “There are four of you
and two of them, and if you try any more of this rough-house
business, Hotch and I will jump into it ourselves
and show you where you get off. You’re about as near a
yellow pup, Lenning, as I know how to describe.”</p>

<p>This did not, in the least, tend to placate Lenning’s
ugly mood.</p>

<p>“Why don’t you move over and join that Ophir
crowd?” he taunted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_172">172</span> “You’re stuck on El Darrel, and
think he’s the whole thing. Why don’t you and Hotchkiss
take your truck and emigrate to Tinaja Wells, so
you can be with Darrel’s friends?”</p>

<p>“We’ll emigrate,” answered Hotchkiss darkly, “but it
won’t be to the Wells. When we hike, by thunder, it’ll
be for home. Eh, Bleek?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know,” Bleeker replied. “And
when I see the colonel,” he added significantly, “I’ll have
something to tell him.”</p>

<p>Lenning was a little startled at that; but his dismay
was only temporary. He was too much enraged to consider
the consequences of his own acts, or of anything
else.</p>

<p>“Talk to my uncle,” snarled Lenning, “and you’ll get
the biggest calling-down you ever had in your life. Furthermore,
Bleeker, if you and Hotch don’t get out of
Camp Hawtrey before sun-down, I’ll see that you’re
properly kicked out. Come on, fellows,” he added to
his three stand-bys, whirling on his heel.</p>

<p>The angry, sullen quartette walked to a little distance,
and Lenning stooped down and picked up the dynamite
cartridge from the place to which Merriwell had thrown
it. Bleeker turned to Frank.</p>

<p>“He’s a pup, that’s all,” grunted Bleeker. “He has
ordered Hotch and me out of camp, but we were about
ready to go, anyhow. We’ve been having merry blazes
at Camp Hawtrey for some time. A few of us Gold
Hillers won’t lick Lenning’s boots—not so you can notice—and
we think Ellis Darrel hasn’t been having a square
deal. That’s put Lenning down on us, and he has been
taking most of his spite out on Hotch and me. I reckon
this is about the finish.”</p>

<p>“I’m plumb satisfied,” grinned Hotchkiss. “If it
hadn’t been for you, Bleek, I’d have hit the trail for
Gold Hill several days ago.”</p>

<p>“I’ve hung on,” continued Bleeker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_173">173</span> “hoping we could
do a little to make a better feeling between our club and
the Ophir fellows. But there’ll never be anything but
scraps and bitterness between the rival athletic clubs as
long as Jode is king-bee of the Gold Hill crowd. That’s
straight. Colonel Hawtrey lets Jode wind him around
his fingers. I should think,” Bleeker added hotly, “that
the old colonel would have sense enough to see through
that measley, two-faced nephew of his. I know him,
by thunder, from a to izzard, and he’s plumb yellow.”</p>

<p>“Clancy and I,” said Merriwell ruefully, “came over
here as a games committee to arrange for a visit of the
Ophir fellows to Camp Hawtrey, but when we saw Jode
and his friends torturing that dog, it stirred us up so that
we jumped into them.”</p>

<p>“Don’t blame you,” said Bleeker. “Hotch and I saw
it all, Merriwell. We were behind another pile of rocks,
and if you hadn’t interfered, we would. Pestering a
dog like that is mean business. The brute has been
hanging around the camp, stealing provisions, and has
been no end of a nuisance, but he didn’t have to be
tortured when he could have been shot out of hand.
Parkman has been laying for that coyote dog for a
couple of days. He got a chance at him this afternoon
and dropped a rope over his head. Jode fixed
up that dynamite cartridge, and when he and his mates
started off with the cartridge and the dog, Hotch and I
followed along, expecting some kind of deviltry. This
is the outcome of it. I wish Hawtrey had been behind
the rocks with us. I’ll bet a bunch of dinero what he
would have seen would have been an eye opener for him.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry as blazes about this flare-up,” muttered
Merriwell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_174">174</span> “It certainly puts a crimp into all our plans
for getting the two clubs together on a friendly basis.
But Clan and I couldn’t hold in when we saw Jode abusing
that cur dog. What do you suppose Hawtrey will
say?”</p>

<p>“He’ll take Jode’s part, sure as shooting. I could tell
Hawtrey a few things, but he wouldn’t believe them.
Jode was right when he said that the colonel would
give me a big calling down if I tried to open up on
his favorite nephew.”</p>

<p>“I left O. Clancy’s private mark on Jode’s chin,” chirruped
Frank’s red-headed comrade, “and I can’t remember
when anything has happened that made me feel so
good. Be hanged to the rest of it. Things will work
out all right, Chip, so don’t fret.”</p>

<p>“If Bradlaugh——”</p>

<p>Merry never finished what he was about to say, for,
at that precise moment, Bleeker and Hotchkiss sprang
into fierce action.</p>

<p>“Run!” shouted Bleeker, as he raced over the rocks;
“run—for your lives!”</p>

<p>Over his shoulder Frank saw a hissing, sputtering object
in the air, coming toward the point where he, and
Clancy, and Bleeker, and Hotchkiss had been standing.
Hotchkiss was already bounding after Bleeker, and in
less than half a second Merry and Clancy were also
hustling like mad to get out of the way.</p>

<p>The hissing object struck ground, and in a moment
there was an explosion, and a little cloud of débris was
flung high in the air.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXVII">CHAPTER XXVII.</a><br />

<small>THE BOY WHO DIDN’T CARE.</small></h2>


<p>It was Lenning, of course, who had lighted the fuse
and hurled that infernal machine in the direction of
Merriwell and those he had been talking with. The
hot-headed recklessness of the act made Merriwell gasp.
Had Bleeker not seen the hissing bomb in the air, and
shouted his warning, what would have happened?</p>

<p>A wave of indignation and anger rushed over Merriwell.
He was running at top speed at the moment of
the explosion, and he continued to run while the booming
echoes reverberated among the hills—but he changed
his course.</p>

<p>Lenning and his friends were clustered together in a
compact group, staring sullenly at the place where the
dynamite had “let go.” All at once they saw Merriwell,
eyes flashing and face like a thundercloud, bearing down
on them.</p>

<p>Perhaps Lenning would have stood his ground had not
his three companions deserted him in a panic. His
courage was of a sort that needed backing, and when his
supporters fled, he whirled and made after them. He
had not gone far, however, before Merriwell overhauled
him, grabbed him by the collar, and jerked him roughly
backward.</p>

<p>Clancy, even more furious than his chum, and Bleeker
and Hotchkiss, both scowling fiercely, made haste to get
to Merriwell’s side. Lenning had been thrown from his
feet, and was lying on the rocks half lifted on one elbow.
There was a look of ugly defiance in his face that did not
match the glimmer of fear in his eyes.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_176">176</span></p>

<p>“You crazy fool!” cried Frank. “Are you trying to
kill somebody?”</p>

<p>“It’s not the first time!” panted Bleeker.</p>

<p>“He ought to be kicked from here plumb to the bottom
of the gulch,” clamored Hotchkiss.</p>

<p>“Let’s pound a little sense into him!” suggested Clancy.</p>

<p>“I don’t care a whoop what happens to you junipers,”
answered Lenning. “Don’t you dare lay a hand on me!
The colonel will make it hot for you if you do.”</p>

<p>“That’s about what I’d expect of you,” came scornfully
from Clancy. “As soon as you earn a good trouncing
you begin whooping it up for your Uncle Alvah.
Oh, you’re the limit, all right.”</p>

<p>“Suppose Bleeker hadn’t seen that lighted bomb coming
toward us?” went on Frank. “What would have happened,
eh?”</p>

<p>“I don’t care a tinker’s darn,” said Lenning. “You
fellows keep your hands off or you’ll wish you had.”</p>

<p>With a roar of anger Clancy attempted to use his fists
on Lenning, but Merriwell put out a restraining arm
and pushed him back. Frank’s temper had had time to
cool a little.</p>

<p>“Stow it, Clan!” said he. “We don’t want to make
this matter any worse than it is, you know.”</p>

<p>“Hang it, Chip,” Clancy protested, “you’re not going
to let this crazy chump try to blow us up and then get
off without a pounding, are you?”</p>

<p>“He’ll get all that’s coming to him before long, and
without any help from us. We’ve made a mess of the
work that brought us to Camp Hawtrey, and it’s just
as well not to complicate matters any more than they
are.”</p>

<p>Frank turned from his chum and gave his full attention
to Lenning.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_177">177</span></p>

<p>“You’re a good deal of a puzzle to me, Lenning,” said
he. “I don’t believe I ever saw a fellow who was just
like you. The reckless way you have of robbing your
uncle and then throwing the responsibility on some one
else, cutting a rope, and dropping your half brother
over a cliff, and lighting dynamite cartridges and throwing
them around, is going to get you into a peck of
trouble. I’ve got a hunch that you’re crazy. If that’s
really the case, then you ought to be in a padded cell,
for it’s a cinch it’s not safe to leave you at large.
Now——”</p>

<p>Lenning had risen hastily to his feet. Something Merriwell
had said had caused his face to go white.</p>

<p>“Look here,” he broke in, “I reckon you found something
I lost on the mesa, over at your camp, during the
football game our crowd had with yours. It was a
note in which Bleeker, there, put down a lie for the purpose
of getting me into trouble. You can’t make any
capital out of what Bleeker says.”</p>

<p>Bleeker, red with anger, tried to get close to Lenning,
but Hotchkiss held him back.</p>

<p>“What I wrote in that note,” cried Bleeker, “was the
truth.”</p>

<p>“You can’t get even with me and help Darrel by any
such talk,” sneered Lenning.</p>

<p>“I’ll finish what I want to say to you,” continued Merriwell
sharply, “and then Clancy and I will be going.
If you try any more desperate games, Lenning, you’ll
be caught at it, sure as fate. If anything happens, we
know where to look for the cause of it, and you can’t
bank on Colonel Hawtrey doing anything to save your
neck. That’s about all.”</p>

<p>He turned away. Lenning, scowling and muttering,
hurried to join his friends, who had kept at a safe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_178">178</span>
distance, and the four vanished on their way down into
the gulch.</p>

<p>“Ain’t that about the worst ever?” murmured Hotchkiss.
“Jode’s pretty near right when he says he don’t
care what he does. He counts on his uncle’s faith in
him to pull him out o’ any trouble he gets into.”</p>

<p>“I wish to thunder the colonel wasn’t such a fool,”
blurted out Bleeker. “Why can’t he get next to the
coyote?”</p>

<p>“He will, some time,” declared Frank. “Where did
that dynamite come from, Bleeker? Do you know?”</p>

<p>“Yes, I know, although pretty nearly our whole camp
is in the dark about it. When Hawtrey was out here, the
last time, he and Jode took a walk along the south wall
of the gulch. Now, the colonel’s got a scent for mineral-bearing
ground same as a hound dog has for a rabbit.
He found a place where he reckoned there might be
gold, and on the q.  t. he sent out some hand drills, a
sledge, some fuse, and a little dynamite, and told Jode to
put down a hole. Jode’s been working with the drill
and sledge, now and then, as he could steal away and
find the time. The colonel told him to put the fuse and
dynamite where it would be safe, and to leave ’em there
until he—the colonel—came out with a box of caps and
asked for the rest of the blasting material. Hawtrey
intends to load and fire the hole himself, I reckon. It’s
dangerous business, and he doesn’t want Jode, or any of
the other fellows, mixed up in it. Jode got a cap
somewhere, and fixed up that cartridge for the coyote
dog.”</p>

<p>“I see,” Frank nodded.</p>

<p>“Jode has made a misplay,” said Hotchkiss.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_179">179</span> “If that
coyote dog had been killed, I reckon he’d have been all
right; but Merriwell stripped off the bomb the cur was
trailin’ and I up and cut the rope. Gee, man, how that
animile skedaddled!”</p>

<p>“How did Jode make a misplay, Hotch?” asked the
puzzled Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Ain’t you ever heard about coyote dogs?” returned
Hotchkiss. “Why, they’re that vengeful they hold a
grouch for years until they pay it off. Abuse a coyote
dog, by thunder, and he’ll make it a p’int to get even.
How about it, Bleek?”</p>

<p>Bleeker nodded solemnly.</p>

<p>“Go on,” jeered Clancy; “you can’t make me swallow
any such stuff as that.”</p>

<p>“You don’t know coyote dogs same as us fellows that
live out in these parts,” persisted Hotchkiss. “Over at
Sacatone a miner kicked one o’ those tramp curs and
broke its leg. Six months after that the miner was found
dead in the trail, all chewed to pieces.”</p>

<p>“Maybe it was a panther did that,” suggested Frank.</p>

<p>“Not on your life, Merriwell! The footprints around
the miner were those of a dog. Lots o’ things like that
have happened.”</p>

<p>“I’m glad, Chip,” chuckled Clancy, “that you and I
are on the safe side. We did what we could for that
homely brute, so he ought to feel sort of friendly toward
us.”</p>

<p>“I guess, fellows,” said Chip, with a laugh, “that
there’s a whole lot of superstition wrapped up in those
yarns about coyote dogs. What’s a coyote dog, anyhow?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_180">180</span></p>
<p>“Just enough coyote in him to make him savage and
wild, and just enough tame dog in him to make him want
to be around where human bein’s congregate. People
who know, treat an animile like that with consideration,
but those who are ignorant make a big mistake when they
try to shoot such a brute, or to hit it with a club.”</p>

<p>“Much obliged for the tip, Hotch,” grinned Frank.
“Whenever I meet a coyote dog, after this, I’ll treat him
with consideration. So long, fellows. Clancy and I
have got to be going.”</p>

<p>Rather grimly, Bleeker and Hotchkiss said “good-by”
to the two lads from Tinaja Wells and started for the
camp where they knew they were unwelcome. Merry
and Clancy turned their faces ’cross country and began
retracing their way to their own headquarters.</p>

<p>Merriwell was in no very pleasant mood. He and
Clancy had started out, that afternoon, with the intention
of inaugurating a little friendly sport with the rival
athletic organization, and the coyote dog had dropped
into the equation and played havoc with their plans.</p>

<p>“I don’t know how the deuce we could have avoided
that mix-up with Jode Lenning,” muttered Merry.</p>

<p>“Well, we could have side-stepped it all right,” returned
Clancy.</p>

<p>“How?”</p>

<p>“Why, by letting them make a skyrocket of the dog,
Chip.”</p>

<p>“Neither of us could stand for that.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_181">181</span></p>
<p>“Sure not, but that was the only way we could have
kept on friendly terms with Lenning. So far’s I’m concerned,
I’ll be hanged if I’d be on friendly terms with
the chump if I could.”</p>

<p>“Lenning doesn’t amount to a whole lot, but Mr. Bradlaugh
and Colonel Hawtrey both want the clubs to be on
a friendly footing. We made a fair beginning with that
football game, and now, while we were trying to keep up
the good work, we’ve knocked what little true sportsmanship
there was about seven ways for Sunday.”</p>

<p>“Lenning has too much influence with the Gold Hill
crowd. He can’t domineer over Bleeker and Hotchkiss,
and so they’ve got to get out. I wish to blazes that
coyote dog would turn up and do business with Jode.
But we can’t hope for any such good luck as that.”</p>

<p>“You’ll be as bloodthirsty as Lenning, Clan, if you keep
on,” grinned Merry.</p>

<p>“Lenning is at the bottom of all the bad blood between
the two clubs,” asserted Clancy warmly, “just as he’s at
the bottom of all Darrel’s troubles. The cub is too mean
to live.”</p>

<p>“Speaking about coyote dogs,” said Frank, “that notion
of Hotch’s is mighty interesting.”</p>

<p>“Hotch, and Bleeker, too, seemed to take a good deal
of stock in the idea. But it’s pretty far-fetched, and——”</p>

<p>A startled expression crossed Clancy’s homely face.
He came to a dead halt, the words died on his lips, and
he lifted one hand quickly and pointed. Frank, following
the direction indicated by his chum’s finger, saw a
tawny form slipping like a specter among the rocks.
The form paused, reared up on a bowlder, and stood
peering over its front paws for a space at the two lads;
then, like an ill-omened wraith, it dropped to all fours
and disappeared as though by magic.</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XXVIII">CHAPTER XXVIII.</h2>

<p>“SPOOKS.”</p>


<p>When Merriwell and Clancy reached Tinaja Wells
and the Ophir camp, late in the afternoon, it was with
the disagreeable feeling that friendly rivalry between the
two clubs had received a setback by recent events from
which it could never recover. Merry at once sought
Handy, captain of the Ophir team, Ballard and Hannibal
Bradlaugh—the latter the son of the club’s president—and
went into a star-chamber session with them.</p>

<p>All the unpleasant details of the afternoon were gone
over, and Ballard, Brad, and Handy listened to them
with absorbing interest.</p>

<p>“What can we expect,” burst out Brad indignantly,
when the recital was finished, “while such a measly pup
as Lenning bosses the Gold Hill crowd? So long as he’s
the king-pin over there, you couldn’t foster a friendly
spirit between the two clubs in a thousand years.”</p>

<p>“That dynamite cartridge gets my goat,” growled Ballard.
“That pleasant habit Lenning has of trying to
assassinate the fellows he doesn’t like will put him behind
the bars one of these days. Thunder! Why, it
doesn’t seem possible he could be such a reckless fool.”</p>

<p>“He’s dangerous,” said Merriwell quietly, “but I don’t
think he’s exactly responsible when his temper’s roused.”</p>

<p>“Take it from me,” observed Handy,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_183">183</span> “there’s something
on the fellow’s conscience. Fear of being found
out is goading him to desperate things. He can’t go on
like this; something has got to be done to stop him before
he commits a sure-enough crime.”</p>

<p>“What’s to be done?” asked Frank. “Tell the
colonel?”</p>

<p>“The colonel!” exclaimed Ballard. “Why, Chip, Lenning
has got the colonel under his thumb. You can’t do
a thing with Hawtrey. Just breathe a whisper against
Lenning to the colonel and there’ll be fireworks. It beats
creation the way Lenning is able to pull the wool over his
uncle’s eyes. Darrel, now, is worth a dozen fellows of
Lenning’s stripe. I’ve been with Darrel for three days
at Dolliver’s place, and I’ve got to know him pretty well.
He’s a prince, that’s what he is; and yet that confounded
old muttonhead of a colonel won’t have a thing to do
with him. When I think about it, sometimes, I get so
mad I feel as though I’d explode.”</p>

<p>“We’d better sleep over this, fellows,” suggested Merriwell,
“and see if we can’t think out some move that will
be right and proper. Things are mighty unsatisfactory,
as they are. It’s been a long time since I’ve had anything
bump me so hard as what happened this afternoon.”</p>

<p>It was in this way that the important matter was dismissed
temporarily. During supper, and for the rest of
that evening, the boys tried to forget it. When they
crawled into their blankets, at ten o’clock, Merriwell’s
mind got busy with the far-reaching subject in spite of
himself.</p>

<p>A guard of three was posted every night. Frank
heard the guards changed at eleven o’clock. Fritz
Gesundheit, the Dutch boy who did the cooking for the
camp, was to be one of the midwatch. It took all of
ten minutes for one of the lads who was going off duty
to get Fritz out of the land of dreams and into a fitting
realization of the fact that it was his turn at sentry-go.</p>

<p>Ghost stories had been indulged in around the camp<span class="pagenum" id="Page_184">184</span>
fire during the evening. Fritz had listened to the wild
yarns with both ears, while washing and putting away
the supper dishes. More than once the cold shivers
had crept up his backbone, and he had felt the carroty
hair rising straight up on his head. When called for
guard duty, he was snoring away with his head under
the blankets.</p>

<p>Fritz’ post was below the flat, and in a part of the
cañon where the moonlight sifted through the trees in
wavering silvery patches. Every patch looked like a
ghost, and the cañon was filled with them.</p>

<p>Fritz was about as eager to go on duty that night
as he would have been to walk into a den of hungry
bears. But Silva, the Mexican packer, was also one of
the midwatch, and between Fritz and Silva was a feud
of several days’ standing. Fritz would have scorned to
show the white feather with Silva looking on, and so he
armed himself with a stout club and a half a dozen ham
sandwiches and waddled feebly down the side of the
flat and into the ghostly shadows of the cañon.</p>

<p>Once a picketed horse gave a snort, and Fritz went
straight into the air for at least five feet. A little later
Uncle Sam, the professor’s mule, let out a “hee haw”
that sounded like thunder in the cañon, and Fritz almost
went into a swoon. Every little while Fritz imagined a
quivering splash of moonlight was a spook, and he would
groan to himself and crowd between the rocks, and say
his prayers backward, forward, and sideways.</p>

<p>Finally, as nothing came up and grabbed him, he began
to feel somewhat reassured. He thought of his sandwiches
and started to eat one.</p>

<p>“Shpooks iss nodding, I bed you,” he communed with
himself. “Nodding nefer hurt nopody at all, und I vill
eat und forged aboudt it. Vat a peacefulness is der<span class="pagenum" id="Page_185">185</span>
nighdt! How calm iss der moon und der leedle
shtars! Oh, I lofe der nighdt, you bed my life, und
I—<i lang ="de">himmelblitzen</i>, vat iss dot?”</p>

<p>Fritz jumped, laid down his half-eaten sandwich on
a bowlder beside him, and peered wildly around. He
could see nothing but the shadowy live stock belonging
to the camp, and yet, very distinctly, he had heard a
<em>pat, pat, pat</em> as of something traveling among the
bowlders.</p>

<p>“Id vas nodding some more,” he chattered. “Imachination
makes some monkey-doodle pitzness mit me. I
vill eat der sandvich und forged aboudt it.”</p>

<p>He reached for the sandwich, and a horrifying surprise
ran through him. The sandwich was not where
he had left it. Nor had it fallen off the rock.</p>

<p>“Br-r-r!” shivered Fritz. “Dere iss a keveerness here,
py shiminy Grismus! Iss a shpook hungry dot he comes
und takes my sandvich?”</p>

<p>For several minutes Fritz sat in a huddle and wondered
what he had better do about it. He would have
eased his tense feelings with a yell if Silva hadn’t been
around to hear. It wouldn’t do to let the Mexican know
he was scared. With trembling hands, Fritz dug down
into his rations for another sandwich. Laying the sandwich
down for a moment, he bent to twist the mouth of
the paper sack in which his lunch was stowed. When
he straightened again, and reached for the sandwich, another
thrill of horror convulsed him. It was gone.</p>

<p>“Py shimineddy,” Fritz fluttered, “dis iss gedding
vorse as I can tell! Vat iss habbening mit me? Iss
it a shpook sandvich? Sooch now-you-see-him-und-now-you-don’t
pitzness I don’t like.” Fritz, just then,
had an illuminating idea which not only calmed his fears
but aroused his wrath.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_186">186</span> “I bed my life id iss dot greaser
feller playing some chokes mit me. I set some draps,
und ven I catch him, I preak him in doo, so hellup me!”</p>

<p>With another sandwich Fritz baited his trap. Laying
the sandwich on the bowlder’s top, he sank down until
his eyes were level with it and the rest of his body hidden
in gloom; then, lifting his hands ready to make a
grab, he waited.</p>

<p><em>Pat, pat</em> came a mysterious sound from the other side
of the bowlder. That must be Silva, Fritz thought, coming
up on his hands and knees.</p>

<p>“Now, I bet you someding for nodding,” Fritz
chuckled, “I get him!”</p>

<p>Something reared up out of the darkness on the other
side of the bowlder. Fritz grabbed, and his hands closed
on an object that felt like a buffalo robe and squirmed
like an eel. Another moment and Fritz had an armful,
for the object plunged straight at him over the bowlder.</p>

<p>“Hellup! hellup!” he howled, as he tumbled backward
and began rolling over and over. “Hellup, I say, oder I
vas a gone Dutchman!”</p>

<p>Then, for several moments, Fritz was altogether too
busy for words. The thing in his arms clawed, and
snapped, and snarled. Fritz continued to roll with it,
sometimes underneath, sometimes on top. He was too
scared to let go, and too scared to hold on; and while he
floundered and plunged about among the rocks, the boys
began to run out of the tents, wondering what the nation
was the matter. At last, locating the excitement in the
cañon, they began racing over the edge of the flat. As
it happened, Merriwell was in the lead.</p>

<small>THE COLONEL CALLS.</small></h2>


<p>When Merriwell was close to the spot where the rolling,
tumbling, and howling was going on, a blot of
shadow darted through the sifting moonlight and was
swallowed up in the gloom of the lower gulch. As the
shadow disappeared, a long, quavering coyote yelp floated
back on the night wind.</p>

<p>A thrill ran through Merriwell’s nerves. Was it a
coyote or a coyote dog that had flung past him and
given vent to that yelp? Instinctively he knew that it
was the wretched mongrel for whose life he and Clancy
had battled in the vicinity of Camp Hawtrey.</p>

<p>Merriwell was conscious of an uncanny feeling, which
laid hold of him as that eerie yelp echoed through the
cañon. What Hotchkiss had told him about coyote dogs
was no doubt responsible for it. With an exclamation
of impatience he flung the feeling from him and went on
to where a figure was sitting up on the ground among
the rocks.</p>

<p>“Py shinks, it vas nod a shpook,” the figure was muttering.
“A shpook iss nodding, und dis vat I hat in
my handts vas more as dot. Yas, you bet my life!”</p>

<p>“Carrots!” exclaimed Merry. “Say,” and he laughed,
scenting a joke of some sort, “what’s the matter with
you?”</p>

<p>“I schust hat a fight mit a bear dot vas pigger as a
house,” Fritz cried.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_188">188</span> “I hat nodding but my hands, und
I vas shoking der life oudt oof dot bear ven you come
oop und schkared him avay mit himselluf. Vy der
tickens,” complained Fritz, “don’t you leaf a feller alone
ven he catches some bears?”</p>

<p>“Whoosh!” chuckled Clancy, as he and several more
lads grouped around the shadowy Fritz. “Fritz was
trapping a bear with his bare hands, and he’s mad because
we came down here when he yelled for help. If
you wanted to be left alone, Carrots, why the deuce did
you make such a racket?”</p>

<p>“I got some oxcidements, dot’s all,” Fritz explained, as
he squirmed to his feet. “Dot bear vas so pig as a
moundain, so hellup me, aber I chuggled him aroundt
like anyding. Fairst, I took him py vone leg und drowed
him der air in, den I took him by some odder legs und
tossed him my headt aroundt, und pooty soon I tropped
him der rocks on, und vas chust gedding retty to sit
down und make him some brisoners ven you fellers
schkared him avay. Vat sort oof pitzness you call dot,
hey?”</p>

<p>“Fritz,” laughed Merriwell, “you’re a four-flusher.
First, you had that bear as big as a house, and now
he’s as big as a mountain. As a matter of fact, Fritz,
the animal was about the size of a dog; and, as another
matter of fact, it was a dog, a coyote dog. I heard him
yelp as he ran down the gulch.”</p>

<p>This came pretty near taking the wind out of Fritz’s
sails.</p>

<p>“You t’ink you know more about dot bear as me?”
he demanded. “I hat him in my arms, py shinks, und
I fight mit him so glose as vat I am to you. I know
vat I know, and dot’s all aboudt it.”</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Ay de mi!</i>” cackled the voice of Silva,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_189">189</span> “he grab one
coyote dog and think him so beeg lak mountain! It ees
most fonny. Fat gringo no tell coyote dog from bear
so beeg lak mountain, huh, huh, huh!”</p>

<p>This, from the hated Silva, was more than Fritz could
stand, and he began forthwith to do a war dance and to
brandish his fists. The clawing he had received from the
coyote dog had not done very much to sweeten his
temper.</p>

<p>“So hellup me cracious,” he whooped, “I vill knock you
py der mittle oof lasdt veek! No greaser lopster can
laugh my face in same as dot.”</p>

<p>He started for Silva, but somebody tripped him and
he pitched sprawling upon the rocky ground.</p>

<p>“Get out of here, Silva!” ordered Merriwell. “I don’t
want any more fussing between you and Fritz.”</p>

<p>The Mexican retired slowly toward his own post,
whistling as though for a missing dog and calling loudly
for the animal to “Come, bonita, come, li’l wan—hyah,
hyah!”</p>

<p>Fritz was fairly boiling with rage. Merriwell helped
him up, ordered him to resume his guard duty, and not
to make any further disturbance, or to try to mix things
with Silva. Then, laughing heartily among themselves,
all the boys went back to their blankets.</p>

<p>“So that coyote dog is hanging around our camp, eh?”
muttered Clancy, as he settled down in bed. “I hope
to thunder, Chip, he hasn’t transferred his affections from
Lenning to you. There’s something about that brute
that gives me the creeps.”</p>

<p>“Oh, slush!” answered Merriwell. “You don’t mean
to say, Clan, that you’re taking any stock in that stuff
Hotchkiss batted up to us?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_190">190</span></p>
<p>“About an abused coyote dog taking the war path as
a lone avenger? Well, no, I’m not so superstitious as
all that, but I can’t get out of my mind that picture of
the miserable brute tied to an ironwood tree, a dynamite
cartridge fastened to his tail, and a bunch of hoodlums
taking pot shots at him. I can just see that dog, Chip,
turning somersaults at the end of the rope while bullets
are kicking up the dust all around him.”</p>

<p>“Forget it, Clan,” said his chum shortly; “go to sleep.”</p>

<p>Amid the silence that dropped over the camp, Silva’s
voice, from the grove, could be heard calling: “Bonita!
li’l wan, coom dis-a-way! Hyah, hyah, hyah!”</p>

<p>Then, from down in the cañon, Fritz would howl
wrathfully: “Vait, you greaser scallavag! Bymby, I bed
you, I make you vistle by der odder site oof your mout’.”</p>

<p>Finally the Mexican tired of jeering at Fritz, and the
boys in the tents succeeded in going to sleep.</p>

<p>Next morning, as Frank was getting into his clothes
after a plunge in the swimming pool, he asked Brad and
Ballard if they had thought of anything that could be
done to straighten out matters between the two athletic
clubs.</p>

<p>“I’m by,” said Brad. “What we’re to do is too many
for me, Chip.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” spoke up Ballard. “I guess there isn’t
a thing we can do but just kick our heels and let things
drift.”</p>

<p>Clancy, at that moment, came dancing up the bank,
grabbed a rough towel, and began sawing it over his
shoulders.</p>

<p>“I’ve thought of a scheme, fellows,” he remarked.</p>

<p>“What sort of a scheme?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_191">191</span></p>
<p>“Lenning’s the stumblingblock. Why not abduct him,
lock him up in some quiet place about a thousand miles
from Nowhere, and leave him there until the rest of the
Gold Hill fellows come to their senses? Take it from
me, Chip, that’s the only way we can work through the
trick.”</p>

<p>“Quit your joshing, Clan,” growled Merry. “This is
serious business.”</p>

<p>“You might just as well lie down on the whole affair
so long as Jode Lenning is at large. You know that as
well as I do. Whenever he cracks his little whip, everybody
in the other camp has to jump—or get out. Bleeker
is one of the best players on the Gold Hill eleven, and yet
you see what happened to him. He and Hotchkiss have
the courage to call their souls their own, and Camp
Hawtrey isn’t big enough for them and Lenning.”</p>

<p>“It’s a tough nut to crack,” muttered Merriwell, frowning.
“We’re supposed to be fostering a spirit of friendly
rivalry with Gold Hill, and here we’ve broken with them
entirely. There’ll be music, before long, and of a kind
I won’t like to hear. What do you suppose your father
will say, Hannibal?”</p>

<p>“Pop’s the clear quill, Chip,” Brad answered. “Half
a dozen words of explanation from you will be enough.
If he finds fault with you about anything, it will be because
you didn’t give Lenning the worst licking he ever
had in his life.”</p>

<p>“That may be,” went on Frank, “but it doesn’t better
the athletic situation any. I don’t suppose I was—er—very
diplomatic. Maybe Clan and I could have saved the
coyote dog without harrowing Jode all up, as we did. I
didn’t stop to consider that part of it when we interfered
with Jode’s amusement.”</p>

<p>“What’s done is done,” said Ballard, “and there’s no
use sobbing about it. I guess, after all, Chip, your
best move is to give the colonel the facts.”</p>

<p>“Wow!” gulped Clancy. “The fur will begin to fly
as soon as Chip tries that. But it’s a cinch that there’s
nothing else to be done.”</p>

<p>“If you lay it down to the colonel, Chip,” put in Brad,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_192">192</span>
“don’t hem, and haw, and side-step. Give Jode the
limit. Tell Hawtrey everything he ought to know about
that rough-neck nephew of his. Throw in all the trimmings.”</p>

<p>“Chip can do it, with ground to spare,” grinned Ballard,
“if he once makes up his mind.”</p>

<p>Merriwell leaned against a tree and dropped his chin
thoughtfully into his hand. He wasn’t more than two
minutes in coming to a conclusion.</p>

<p>“I’m going to Gold Hill,” he announced, “and I’ll start
right after dinner.”</p>

<p>“That means you’re going to beard the colonel in his
den,” said Clancy. “Want me along as a bodyguard?”</p>

<p>“And me?” asked Ballard.</p>

<p>“No, Pink, I don’t want you, or Clan, or any one
else,” Merry answered. “I intend to handle this alone.”</p>

<p>“That’s the stuff!” approved Brad. “You can do more,
all by your lonesome, than with half a dozen fellows
trailing after you. Hawtrey has a heap of respect for
you, Chip. His admiration for your father has something
to do with the way he sizes you up, I reckon. He
knows you’re a chip of the old block, and a square sportsman
from soles to headpiece. If anybody can talk to
him about Jode, and get away with it, you’re the one.”</p>

<p>“Well, that’s the program,” said Merriwell grimly,
“whether I’m the one or not. When I get after Jode
I’m going to handle him without gloves.”</p>

<p>“What will Darrel think about it?” inquired Ballard.</p>

<p>“Search me. I think, though, that he’ll take it all
right. Lenning’s actions have reached a point where
they’ve got to receive immediate attention.”</p>

<p>Following breakfast, that morning, Frank and his
chums, under Professor Phineas Borrodaile’s supervision,
took up their studies for the forenoon. No matter what<span class="pagenum" id="Page_193">193</span>
was going on, the professor insisted relentlessly on the
three lads applying themselves to their books for the first
half of the day.</p>

<p>Merriwell’s attention wandered a good deal. He was
wondering how he had better approach the colonel on
the delicate subject he had in mind. His acquaintance
with Hawtrey was not of very long standing, and he
might almost call himself a stranger to the big man of
Gold Hill. Frank winced when he thought of broaching
the matter—which was largely a family affair—to
Lenning’s uncle.</p>

<p>As soon as the forenoon was over, and dinner out of
the way, Frank made his preparations for the ride to
Gold Hill. While he was engaged with them, Ballard
suddenly thrust his head into the tent.</p>

<p>“You won’t need to take that trip to Gold Hill, Chip,”
announced Ballard.</p>

<p>“Why not?”</p>

<p>“Because the colonel is here, old man. He’s got a
chip on each shoulder, too, if I’m any judge. He wants
you, and no one else. Say, but he’s in a temper!”</p>

<p>“I’ve got a job on my hands,” muttered Merry, “and
no mistake. Tell him I’ll be along in about two minutes,
Pink.”</p>

<p>Frank nerved himself for what he knew was to be an
ordeal, and presently he left the tent and made his way
toward the place where Colonel Hawtrey, in the worst
kind of a temper, was pacing back and forth under
the cottonwoods.</p>

<small>MERRIWELL MISJUDGED.</small></h2>


<p>The lads of the camp, aware that something momentous
was brewing, kept at a discreet distance from
the colonel. They were plainly ill at ease, although it
was equally plain that they were trying not to show it.
Ballard, Clancy, Brad, and Handy formed a little group
by themselves. They had inside information as to what
was going on, and watched developments with considerably
more anxiety than the rest of the campers.</p>

<p>Frank walked briskly up to Colonel Hawtrey and put
out his hand with a smile.</p>

<p>“Good afternoon, colonel,” said he pleasantly. “Glad
to see you.”</p>

<p>The colonel paid no attention to the extended hand.
Leaning back against his saddle horse, he hooked his
left arm around the pommel of the saddle and allowed
the fingers of his right hand to fumble with a watch
chain. His snapping eyes fixed themselves on the frank,
handsome face of the lad in front of him.</p>

<p>“Merriwell,” said he cuttingly, “I’m disappointed in
you. I thought you were a worthy son of your father,
and I repeat that I’ve been badly disappointed.”</p>

<p>“I’m sorry for that, sir,” Frank answered, flushing a
little as he lowered his hand. “You have been to Camp
Hawtrey?”</p>

<p>“I’ve just come from there; and, when I leave here, I’m
going back. What have you to say for yourself—anything?
I didn’t think you were a rowdy and a trouble
maker.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_195">195</span></p>

<p>“You’ve heard one side of the story, colonel,” said
Frank, keeping himself well in hand, “and don’t you
think, in the interest of fair play, you ought to hear both
sides?”</p>

<p>“What else,” demanded the colonel, “do you suppose
I came over here for?”</p>

<p>“From your actions it looks as though you had made
up your mind that I am in the wrong.”</p>

<p>“I have—I am sure of it. Jode has told me everything,
and three of Jode’s companions have vouched for
his statements. The testimony is of the very best.”</p>

<p>“Then, if you are so sure you have got the right of
it, what was the use of coming here to talk with me?”</p>

<p>Frank was nettled by the colonel’s injustice. He tried
hard to restrain himself and to give the older man
the respect which was rightfully his due, but a little
temper flashed in his words.</p>

<p>“Young man,” was the icy response, “I try to be a
true sportsman; and, while you and that red-headed chum
of yours have made a sorry exhibition of yourselves, I
have an idea as to where the cause lies. You are at
fault, of course, but I do not think that you are quite
as much at fault as some one else whom I could name.”</p>

<p>“You mean Darrel?” Frank asked quickly.</p>

<p>“Yes.”</p>

<p>“Then,” said Frank warmly, “I want to tell you that
you are mistaken, and that Ellis Darrel hadn’t the first
thing to do with what happened near Camp Hawtrey
yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“You are under the influence of that scapegrace
nephew of mine,” stormed the colonel. “Do you think
I’m not able to see it? He has set you against Jode.
Do you admire a sneak, Merriwell? What, under<span class="pagenum" id="Page_196">196</span>
heavens, has got into you that you can’t see through
the plans of that—that young marplot?”</p>

<p>Here was the colonel, wrong in every way because of
Lenning’s influence, accusing his other nephew of being
a sneak and a marplot. Frank rallied promptly to the
defense of his new chum.</p>

<p>“Darrel is not a sneak, sir,” said he. “I’m not under
his influence, either, in forming my own estimate of Jode
Lenning.”</p>

<p>The colonel tossed his hand deprecatingly.</p>

<p>“Do you deny,” he asked, “that you and Clancy went
over to the other camp, yesterday, and stirred up a disgraceful
fight with Jode and three of his friends?”</p>

<p>“No, sir, I don’t deny that Clancy and I had trouble
with Jode.”</p>

<p>“Clancy knocked Jode down. Do you deny that?”</p>

<p>“No. If Clancy hadn’t knocked him down, I should
probably have done it myself. He deserved it. Did
Jode tell you that he struck Clancy first?”</p>

<p>“That is not true!” asserted the colonel. “You and
your friend began the fight. All Jode and his friends did
was to defend themselves. Any lad, with the right sort
of spirit, will fight back when he’s set upon. Jode is
not a coward. If he hadn’t fought, I should have felt
like giving him a trouncing myself.”</p>

<p>It looked to Frank like a hopeless job, trying to set
the colonel right. He was so dominated by the influence
of Lenning, that he took for gospel all that Lenning told
him—especially since Hummer, Lamson, and Parkman
vouched for the truth of Lenning’s statements.</p>

<p>“Is Bleeker at Camp Hawtrey, colonel?” inquired
Frank calmly. “Or Hotchkiss?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_197">197</span></p>
<p>“Those two fellows have made themselves extremely
disagreeable to all the others in our camp,” replied the
colonel, “and, very properly, Jode sent them packing.”</p>

<p>“Bleeker and Hotchkiss could tell you a few things
about that row, colonel, which Jode and his friends didn’t
think necessary to mention.”</p>

<p>“They’re out with Jode, and they’d try to injure him
if they could. I don’t care to talk with either of them.”</p>

<p>“Then, colonel, I’m going to tell you what started the
racket. If you think Jode acted like a true sportsman,
I’ll have nothing more to say. I want you to remember,
though, that I was brought up to hate a lie, and that
what you hear from me is the truth.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the colonel.</p>

<p>“Clancy and I set out for your camp to arrange for a
series of competitions,” went on Frank. “We wanted
to do everything possible to cause a better feeling between
the two clubs, and stirring up trouble was the last
thing in our minds. Before we got to the camp, though,
we saw Jode and three of his friends blazing away at a
coyote dog with a revolver.”</p>

<p>“That coyote dog was a camp robber,” put in the
colonel. “It was perfectly right for the boys to shoot
him.”</p>

<p>“Why, yes, if it was plain shooting they were going
to do; but what right had they to torture the brute?”</p>

<p>“There was nothing in the way of torture whatever,”
declared the colonel.</p>

<p>“Is tying a dynamite cartridge to a dog’s tail and lighting
the fuse torture?” demanded Frank.</p>

<p>“Nothing of that sort was done.”</p>

<p>Frank gasped. How was he to make any headway
against all this misinformation which the colonel had
received from Jode? And it was misinformation which
the colonel accepted in every detail.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_198">198</span></p>

<p>“Colonel,” continued Frank earnestly, “I was there and
I know what took place. Clancy and I didn’t interfere,
until Jode had ordered one of the boys to light the fuse
and another one to cut the dog loose. It was a brutal
business. Clancy and I stopped it; and, if we had it to
do over, we would stop it again.”</p>

<p>“I shall not dispute with you, Merriwell,” returned
the colonel. “I consider that the source of my information
is perfectly reliable.”</p>

<p>“I have something else to tell you,” Frank said respectfully,
but none the less firmly, “and if you don’t believe
me now you will some time. I cut the cartridge
away from the dog and threw it off among the rocks.
While Clancy and I were talking with Bleeker and Hotchkiss,
Jode lighted the fuse and threw the cartridge
toward us.”</p>

<p>“Merriwell!” The colonel’s eyes dilated, and angry
protest was in his voice.</p>

<p>“Jode,” Frank quietly continued, “never shouted one
word of warning when he let that infernal machine fly
at us. Bleeker saw it, and he and Hotchkiss began to
run. Clancy and I took to our heels and just managed
to get out of the way before the cartridge exploded.”</p>

<p>“You are trying to make Jode out a murderous scoundrel,”
cried Hawtrey, “and I shall not stay here and listen
to such talk.”</p>

<p>“You’d better listen; not only that, but you’d better
take Jode in hand and do something with him. He’s
crazy. If he tries any more tricks of that sort, I’ll put
the matter in the hands of Hawkins, the deputy sheriff.”</p>

<p>Angrily the colonel swung to his saddle. The subject
of the dynamite cartridge he did not pursue any
further. Evidently Jode had given his version of the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_199">199</span>
affair, and the colonel had more faith in Jode than in
Merriwell.</p>

<p>“What I regret most about all this,” said the colonel,
speaking from the saddle and in a voice which he tried
to make calm and judicial, “is that it breaks off at once
all friendly rivalry between the two athletic clubs. The
matter is worse, infinitely worse, than it was before you
came to Ophir and took a prominent part in the affairs
of the Ophir organization. There will be no football
game between Gold Hill and Ophir this year.”</p>

<p>Hawtrey snapped out the last words, set his square
jaw doggedly, and touched his horse with the spurs.
Looking neither to left nor right, he galloped down into
the cañon and out of sight along the narrow trail.</p>

<p>Clancy, Ballard, Brad, and Handy hurried over to
the place where Merriwell was standing.</p>

<p>“What did he say?” all four of the youngsters asked,
in one breath.</p>

<p>“He said a good many things,” Merry answered, “but
about the bitterest dose I had to swallow was what he
said about the football game with Gold Hill. It’s all
off, fellows.”</p>

<p>“All off?” echoed Handy, as though he scarcely believed
his ears. “What has a little row with Lenning
got to do with that?”</p>

<p>“I guess the colonel thinks we’re a lot of plug-uglies
and might turn the game into a Donnybrook fair. Jode
has pumped him full, and Lamson, Parkman, and Hummer
have backed Jode up in everything. The colonel,
of course, is taking their word for it all. He didn’t
tell me flatly that I lied, although he might as well have
done so. Lenning has made him think, Clan, that you
and I went over to Camp Hawtrey just to pick a row.”</p>

<p>“Of course,” said Clancy sardonically,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_200">200</span> “what else
could you expect? How did Jode get around the dynamite
cartridge?”</p>

<p>“By saying there wasn’t any such thing.”</p>

<p>“All the colonel has got to do, Chip, is to look at the
hole in the ground where it went off.”</p>

<p>“Funny thing about it is,” Merry went on, “the colonel
blames Darrel, he thinks Curly goaded us on to pick a
row with Lenning.”</p>

<p>That brought a laugh, all the lads wondering how
such a foolish notion could be entertained by Hawtrey
for a single moment. Lenning, they agreed, must have
contrived to give the colonel that impression.</p>

<p>“I’m going down the gulch to talk with Darrel,” said
Frank. “If I were you, Handy, I wouldn’t say anything
to the boys about the colonel’s calling the football game
off. There’s a chance that Mr. Bradlaugh may be able
to smooth over the differences, so that the game will be
played according to schedule. Want to ride with me,
Pink, you and Clan?”</p>

<p>Ballard and Clancy were eager to go with Merriwell
and have a talk with Darrel. In a few minutes all three
of the chums were mounted and galloping toward Dolliver’s.</p>

<small>DARREL’S RESOLVE.</small></h2>


<p>On the afternoon which witnessed Merriwell’s and
Clancy’s disastrous experiences near Camp Hawtrey,
Ellis Darrel had been laid up nearly a week with his
broken arm. He had been taken to Dolliver’s because
the Ophir lads knew that the ranch offered more comforts
than could possibly be had in the camp at Tinaja
Wells. Dolliver, too, had telephone connection with
Ophir, and but little time had been lost in getting a
doctor.</p>

<p>Darrel was young and, at the time of his injury, in perfect
physical health. A year of roughing it in the West,
all the way from British Columbia to Mexico, had put
a keen edge on his powers of endurance. For him,
therefore, a broken arm did not cause the mischief which
would have been the case in one less hardened and
robust.</p>

<p>In three or four days he was out of bed, and sitting
around Dolliver’s with his arm in a sling. Enforced
idleness worried and fretted him. On the very day
Frank and Owen had saved the coyote dog, Darrel had
begun contemplating a return to Tinaja Wells.</p>

<p>The one thing in all the world which Darrel desired
with a full heart was to prove his innocence in the
forgery matter. He felt that he could not rest easy
a moment until he had probed that forgery to the bottom
and had unmasked the person who had written the name
of Alvah Hawtrey on the five-hundred-dollar check.</p>

<p>The colonel, after considering the circumstantial evi<span class="pagenum" id="Page_202">202</span>dence,
had reached the conclusion that Darrel was the
forger. He had therefore turned the boy from his door
and would have nothing more to do with him. To wipe
that blot from his name was Darrel’s one purpose in
life. Merriwell had promised his help, but Darrel believed
that it was his duty to do most of the work for
himself.</p>

<p>After supper, in the evening of the day so many important
events had happened at Camp Hawtrey, Darrel
was sitting with the rancher in front of the house.</p>

<p>The cloudless Arizona sky was never more beautiful.
When the sun sets in the Southwest, it drops out of
sight suddenly, and night falls as swiftly as a drop curtain.
One moment it is day; then, almost the next moment,
the clear-cut stars are glittering overhead.</p>

<p>The entrance to Mohave Cañon was but a little distance
away and facing the front of Dolliver’s house. The
opening yawned like a huge black cavity on the sky line,
stretching into the far distance amid ominous shadows.</p>

<p>With dreamy eyes young Darrel stared across the
trail and into the gloomy gulch. Somehow the last year
of his life resembled that cañon as he saw it then. That
forgery had flung him into a black and forbidding path,
through which he had wandered—and was still wandering—aimlessly.
Would he never be able to fight his way
out of the gloom and the dishonor and regain his rightful
place in his uncle’s esteem, and in the eyes of honest
men?</p>

<p>While Dolliver, a man of few words, like all who live
much by themselves, sat silently and smoked his short
black pipe, and while Darrel still gazed reflectively into
the black mouth of the cañon, two figures slowly disentangled
themselves from the shadows and bore down
on the ranch.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_203">203</span></p>

<p>“Some ’un from up the gulch,” Dolliver roused to remark,
“mebbyso from Tinaja Wells.”</p>

<p>But they were not from the Wells. As the riders
came close and halted, Darrel discovered that they were
two whom he knew—Bleeker and Hotchkiss.</p>

<p>“Great jumpin’ sandhills!” exclaimed the voice of
Hotchkiss. “That you, Darrel?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” laughed Darrel. “Why not?”</p>

<p>“We reckoned you would still be in bed, El,” spoke up
Bleeker. “Must be pulling along in fine shape, eh?”</p>

<p>“How long do you think a busted arm ought to keep a
fellow down, anyhow?”</p>

<p>“Depends a heap on the fellow, El. Between you, and
me, and the gatepost, I don’t believe anything’ll keep you
down very long.”</p>

<p>“Can’t you get off and stop a while?” Darrel asked.</p>

<p>“No. We’re bound for Gold Hill. Been kicked out
of Camp Hawtrey.”</p>

<p>“Kicked out? Great Scott! What do you mean by
that, Bleek?”</p>

<p>“Down at the bottom of it, we’re friends of yours, and
Jode don’t want us around. Something happened up
at the camp, this afternoon, that brought matters to a
show-down.”</p>

<p>“What was that?”</p>

<p>Bleeker crooked one knee around the saddle horn
and rested easily while he told about the trouble over
the coyote dog.</p>

<p>“That’s what happened,” said he, when the recital was
finished, “and I’ll bet a pound of prunes against a toothpick
that Jode’s laying to unload a little of the trouble
onto you.”</p>

<p>“How could he do that?” queried Darrel.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_204">204</span></p>
<p>“Why, by making his uncle believe that your unholy
influence sent Merriwell and Clancy to our camp to kick
up a row. Parkham has already been sent to the Hill
after the colonel. He’ll be out here, bright and early,
to-morrow morning; then Jode will sing his little song
and make the colonel believe just what he wants him to.
The friendly relations of the two clubs have had a
knock-out blow. There’ll be nothing doing, in an
athletic way, for some time to come. Pretty tough on
Merriwell. But he’ll come out all right, for that’s a
way he has. Get well as quick as you can, pard, and
then come on to Gold Hill. There are a lot of us there
that are ready to fight for you. <i lang ="es-mx">Buenas noches!</i>”</p>

<p>Bleeker straightened around in his saddle and rattled
his spurs. Presently he and Hotchkiss were clattering
away along the main trail in the direction of home.</p>

<p>These revelations came to Darrel like a blow. He
felt, and perhaps he was right, that Merriwell’s friendship
for him had made an enemy of Jode.</p>

<p>“What do you think of that, Dolliver?” asked Darrel,
appealing to the rancher.</p>

<p>“Why,” was the answer, “I opine that half brother o’
yourn is about as onnery as they make ’em.”</p>

<p>“I’m the one who is at the bottom of Merriwell’s
trouble with Jode.”</p>

<p>“You can’t help it if ye are. Better hit the hay, son.
I reckon you’ve been up a heap too long as it is.”</p>

<p>Darrel went to bed that night pondering the subject
of Merriwell’s failure to inspire a friendly spirit in the
dealings between the two athletic clubs.</p>

<p>“He could have succeeded,” was Darrel’s bitter conclusion,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_205">205</span>
“if it hadn’t been for his friendship for me.
What will Jode be trying next, I wonder? Where is
that fiendish temper of his going to land him, if something
isn’t done to curb it?”</p>

<p>Long into the night Darrel canvassed the unpleasant
problem in his mind. As a consequence, he went to sleep
about midnight and woke up with the sun at least two
hours’ high.</p>

<p>“Has my uncle passed on his way to Camp Hawtrey,
Dolliver?” were his first words when he found the
rancher.</p>

<p>“All of an hour ago,” was the reply.</p>

<p>“I wanted to talk with him,” muttered Darrel.</p>

<p>“A heap o’ palverin’ you’d ‘a’ done with <em>him</em>,” grunted
Dolliver. “The kunnel ain’t eager for no conversation
with you, son.”</p>

<p>Darrel realized that, but it did not alter his determination
to see if he could not talk with his uncle and try
to make things easier for Merriwell.</p>

<p>The morning passed slowly, Darrel deciding one moment
that duty called him to Tinaja Wells and Merriwell,
and again that his proper course was to ride to
Camp Hawtrey and interview the colonel.</p>

<p>Noon came, and Darrel ate little of the food Dolliver
had set out on the kitchen table.</p>

<p>“If ye don’t eat,” grumbled Dolliver, “ye can’t expect
to git around very soon.”</p>

<p>Darrel’s mind was on something else besides his
dinner.</p>

<p>“I wish you’d saddle up a horse for me, Dolliver,”
he said. “I’m going to take a ride.”</p>

<p>“More’n likely ye’ll fall off before ye’ve gone fur.
Where ye goin’ to ride?”</p>

<p>“Camp Hawtrey.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_206">206</span></p>
<p>“Take a fool’s advice, son, and don’t.”</p>

<p>“I’m going to talk with the colonel. If you won’t put
the gear on a horse for me, I reckon I can manage it
myself.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll do it, if ye’re bound ter ride. But wait a
couple o’ hours. It’s plumb in the heat o’ the day, and
ridin’ ’ll come a heap harder for you now than it will
later.”</p>

<p>An hour or two would make little difference, and Darrel
laid down on his bed for a short rest before taking
the ride. He fell asleep almost immediately, and was
awakened by a familiar voice trying to get some one
over the telephone. It was his uncle, there in the room
with him, asking for Bradlaugh’s office. Bradlaugh was
not in, evidently.</p>

<p>“Tell him,” said Colonel Hawtrey, “that I’ll talk with
him from here late this afternoon. This is mighty important—don’t
neglect to tell him that.”</p>

<p>Colonel Hawtrey had just ridden down the cañon after
his talk with Merriwell. He was still red and wrathful.
As he whirled from the telephone, he was confronted
by Darrel.</p>

<p>The boy’s face was as white as the bandage that
swathed his arm, but he stood resolutely between his
uncle and the open outside door.</p>

<p>“Colonel,” he began, “I want you to listen to me.
I’m not talking for myself, but for Merriwell. Don’t
think that I——”</p>

<p>“Not a word,” snapped the colonel. “You haven’t
anything to say that I care to hear.”</p>

<p>He strode around Darrel. The boy stepped forward
to lay a detaining hand on his arm. Roughly the colonel
shook him off, hurried from the house, vaulted into
the saddle of his waiting horse, and spurred for the
cañon. He did not so much as look back.</p>

<p>“Nice way for an uncle to treat his nephew!” exclaimed
Dolliver, from a place outside the house near
the door. “But I told ye how it ’u’d be,” he added.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_207">207</span></p>

<p>“He can’t shake me like that!” cried Darrel. “I’m
going to do what I can to straighten out this trouble
of Merriwell’s. Get the horse for me, Dolliver, and
I’ll hike right after him.”</p>

<p>“Ye’ve got plenty o’ nerve, son, but blame’ poor jedgment,”
growled the rancher.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you call me,” demanded Darrel, “when
you saw him coming?”</p>

<p>“Didn’t see him comin’. Didn’t have a notion anybody
had dropped in till I saw the strange hoss at the
hitchin’ pole.”</p>

<p>“Will you get the horse for me, Mr. Dolliver?”</p>

<p>The “mister” was pretty formal. The fact that Darrel
used it proved that he was on edge and would not
take “no” for an answer.</p>

<p>Dolliver got the horse and helped Darrel into the
saddle. He wished him luck, too, although in the same
breath he declared that the boy was running a big risk
and would have his trouble for nothing.</p>

<p>Darrel’s pale face was set resolutely as he urged the
horse into a gallop and disappeared through the mouth
of the cañon.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXII" id="CHAPTER_XXXII">CHAPTER XXXII.</a><br />

<small>THE LEDGE AT THE GULCH.</small></h2>


<p>In a great many ways Merriwell had shown his friendship
for Ellis Darrel. From the very first, when Darrel
had reached the camp at Tinaja Wells as the “boy
from Nowhere,” Merriwell had believed in him and had
befriended him.</p>

<p>As he rode toward Camp Hawtrey, Darrel recalled how
cleverly Merriwell had defended him against the charge
of robbing the colonel’s safe. So successful was the defense
that even the stern old colonel was forced to
admit that Darrel was innocent.</p>

<p>And again, at the time the rope had given way and
Darrel had fallen on the cliff, it was Merriwell who
had risked his neck to climb to the ledge where Darrel
lay unconscious, had fastened a rope about him, and had
lowered him to safety. It was Merriwell, too, who had
played “a game within a game” on the football field and
had taken from Lenning certain evidence of Lenning’s
scoundrelly work.</p>

<p>As a slight repayment for all this loyalty and friendship,
Darrel felt that he should do what he could to
straighten out the misunderstanding between the colonel
and Merriwell.</p>

<p>Even if he could get the colonel’s attention, Darrel
was doubtful of his ability to sway the colonel toward
Merriwell’s side. It was a time, however, when Darrel
was resolved to give himself the benefit of every doubt,
in the hope of being of some service to his friend.</p>

<p>If Jode was successful in making the colonel believe<span class="pagenum" id="Page_209">209</span>
that Darrel’s influence had caused the trouble between
him and Merriwell, then Darrel would do his utmost to
set his uncle right on that point. This, very likely, would
put an altogether different complexion on the clash about
the coyote dog.</p>

<p>If convinced that Darrel had nothing to do with the
actions of Merriwell and Clancy, the colonel might be
in a receptive mood so far as evidence against Jode was
concerned. This, at least, was what Darrel hoped.</p>

<p>A mile or so from the mouth of the cañon the right-hand
wall was broken into by the mouth of a gulch. This
gulch was the one in which the Gold Hill Boys had
pitched their camp.</p>

<p>Years before, a mining company had thrown a dam
across the mouth of the gulch. This dam had backed
up the water for several miles.</p>

<p>Darrel turned his horse into the gulch and followed a
bridle path that led onward close to the water’s edge.
Rapidly, as he advanced, the gulch widened out. The
slopes on either side of the stream became less steep,
pine trees began to show themselves, and flaming poppies,
in irregular beds, made the slopes look like terraced
gardens.</p>

<p>“First time I ever knew there was a place like this
holed away among these hills,” muttered the boy, staring
around him with all the delight aroused by a new and
pleasant discovery. “It’s a mighty fine place, and no
mistake. Where’s that camp, I wonder?”</p>

<p>Pulling the horse to a halt, he lifted himself in the
stirrups and peered ahead. He could not see the gleam
of the tents, but he did see something else which caused
him to utter an exclamation of surprise and disappointment.</p>

<p>In the distance two figures were moving in his direc<span class="pagenum" id="Page_210">210</span>tion,
on foot. One of them was the colonel, as he could
see plainly, and the other was Jode.</p>

<p>“Beastly luck!” grumbled Darrel. “How can I talk
with the colonel if Jode’s around? I’ll just leave the
horse in the brush and watch them, for a spell. Maybe
Jode will leave the colonel, and I’ll get my chance.”</p>

<p>Quickly turning the horse from the trail, Darrel
spurred up the slope of the gulch wall for a short distance
and rode into a chaparral of mesquite. Here he dismounted,
hitched the horse to a scraggly paloverde, and
crept back to the edge of the bushes to watch.</p>

<p>He had had no exercise to amount to anything for
nearly a week, and he was astonished to find how his
exertions tired him. He half reclined as he stared out
of the thicket, resting as he watched the trail for the
colonel and Jode to appear.</p>

<p>It was plain that the two could not be going far from
the camp. Had they been traveling any considerable
distance, they would have brought their mounts.</p>

<p>Not many minutes passed before the two hove in
sight. Only a little way from the place where Darrel
had turned from the trail, the colonel and Jode altered
their course and began climbing the slope. The colonel
was carrying a small package wrapped in brown paper.</p>

<p>It seemed evident to Darrel that the two from the
camp would pass within a few yards of the chaparral.
What if they discovered the horse? The boy compressed
his lips sternly. If that happened, then he would show
himself at once and talk to the colonel, in spite of Jode.
But he hoped the horse would not be seen, and that he
could watch his chances and have the colonel all to himself
for a few minutes.</p>

<p>The climb must have tired the colonel, for he halted
and sat down on a convenient bowlder for a brief rest.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_211">211</span>
Jode dropped to the ground at his side. They were not
more than twenty feet from Darrel.</p>

<p>“It won’t take me ten minutes to load the hole and set
off the charge, Jode,” the colonel was saying, “and then
we’ll see what sort of rock we uncover. There’s a vein
there—I’m too old a hand at the business to be fooled—but
whether it amounts to much or not remains to be
seen.”</p>

<p>“You’re mighty clever at this sort of business, Uncle
Al,” returned Jode admiringly. “I wish I knew as much
about dips, angles, and formations as you do.”</p>

<p>“It won’t be necessary for you to work along that
line, my boy,” said the colonel affectionately. “You’re
to educate yourself for commercial work, and learn to
take care of what I shall one day leave you.”</p>

<p>“I hope,” observed Jode, “that it will be a long time
before I shall be called on to do that. There’s no chance,
you think, of patching up our differences with the Ophir
fellows?”</p>

<p>“No chance—at least, not so long as Merriwell has
anything to do with the Ophir team. I’ve cancelled the
Thanksgiving Day game.”</p>

<p>“That’s pretty tough! I think, uncle, we could play
Ophir, even with Merriwell in their crowd, and show
them that we can be square and let bygones be bygones.”</p>

<p>“What you say, Jode, does you a lot of credit. Our
boys are gentlemen, however, and not hoodlums. I could
not sanction your playing with a team where such a
spirit as Merriwell and Clancy showed yesterday is liable
to crop out at any moment.”</p>

<p>“Whatever you say goes, Uncle Al. But I wish the
thing could be patched up in some way.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_212">212</span></p>
<p>“Well, I don’t see how it can. Mr. Bradlaugh has
placed Merriwell in charge of the Ophir eleven, and a
team is bound to reflect the spirit of the coach. There’ll
be no more exhibitions of petty partisanship between
the two clubs if I can help it.” The colonel got up
and stooped to lay hold of the bundle he had been carrying.
“What’s the matter?” he asked, starting quickly
erect.</p>

<p>Jode had given a jump and uttered a startled exclamation.</p>

<p>“I—I thought I saw that coyote dog among the rocks,
up toward the ledge,” he answered, in a smothered voice.</p>

<p>“What if you did?”</p>

<p>“Why, I heard—some one in the camp told me—that
a coyote dog always lays for the fellow who tries to
hurt him or——”</p>

<p>“Stuff and nonsense!” scoffed the colonel. “You
ought to be above such superstitious notions, Jode. Never
mind if you did catch a glimpse of the dog. Come on
and we’ll go up to the ledge and do our work there.”</p>

<p>“I wish I’d brought my revolver,” said Jode, as he
again began climbing at his uncle’s side.</p>

<p>“You’ll not need your revolver.”</p>

<p>Contrary to Darrel’s fears, the two passed well to the
side of the chaparral. The colonel’s mind was busy with
the work that lay ahead of him, and Jode was still plainly
experiencing a few qualms on the score of the coyote
dog. As he climbed, Jode’s shifty eyes were fixed on
the rocks where he believed he had caught sight of the
skulking animal.</p>

<p>What Darrel had overheard pass between his half
brother and the colonel gave him a queer feeling of regret
for the part he was playing. It seemed almost as
though he was a spy and an eavesdropper. The colonel’s
affection for Jode was deep and sincere, there could not<span class="pagenum" id="Page_213">213</span>
be the slightest doubt; but Jode’s manner, his very talk,
to Darrel’s mind, lacked all that the colonel’s so frankly
expressed.</p>

<p>“What business is it of mine?” thought Darrel bitterly.
“So long as I am under a cloud I have no right
to criticize Jode. I wish he’d clear out and give me a
chance at the colonel.”</p>

<p>Some twenty or thirty feet above the chaparral, and
forty or fifty feet to the left of it, was a ledge of rock
standing straight out from the sloping gulch wall. A
mass of loose bowlders overhung the ledge.</p>

<p>This was the spot toward which the colonel and Jode
were climbing. Observing this, Darrel quietly forced his
way upward along one side of the patch of mesquite. At
the upper edge of the chaparral he found a rift in the
slope. It was like a trench, deep enough to hide a
man, and ran straight toward the crest of the gulch
wall.</p>

<p>Still watching and hoping for an opportunity to speak
a few words in private with the colonel, Darrel crawled
into the trench and made his way to a point that was
on a level with the top of the ledge. When he finally
halted and peered over the edge of the rift, he found
that some thirty feet of rough ground separated him from
the colonel and Jode.</p>

<p>The colonel was on his knees, carefully opening the
parcel he had brought with him. A small coil of fuse
and a couple of sticks of dynamite were presently taken
from the package.</p>

<p>“There were three sticks here when I wrapped up the
package in Gold Hill,” said the colonel, lifting his eyes
to Jode’s. “What’s become of the rest of the dynamite?”</p>

<p>“Are you sure?” Jode answered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_214">214</span> “Some one must
have taken out one of the sticks.”</p>

<p>“Of course I may be mistaken,” muttered the colonel.</p>

<p>Cutting off a length of fuse, he trimmed it with a
pocket knife; then, taking a cap from his pocket, he
pushed it over the trimmed end. Next, he picked up
one of the sticks of giant powder, slit it lengthwise on
four sides, and dropped it into a hole that had been
drilled in the shelf. The other stick was pushed down
on the first, and both were gently tamped down on the
cap, which was in the bottom of the hole.</p>

<p>“Now, clear out, Jode,” said the colonel. “It’s only
a two-minute length of fuse, and I shall have to scramble
for safety when I touch it off.”</p>

<p>Jode jumped from the ledge and hurried to get away
among a lot of bowlders at a safe distance. The colonel
lighted a match, touched it to the fuse, and Darrel flattened
himself out in the bottom of the rift.</p>

<p>The next moment he heard a crash, but it was not the
crash of an explosion. A startled cry came from the
colonel, and Darrel, thrilled with a weird premonition
of disaster, rose to his knees and again looked out over
the top of the rift. What he saw, there on the ledge
of the gulch wall, caused him to gasp and close his eyes
to shut out the horror of it.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIII" id="CHAPTER_XXXIII">CHAPTER XXXIII.</a><br />

<small>FOLLOWING DARREL.</small></h2>


<p>Frank and his chums, in riding from Tinaja Wells to
Dolliver’s, passed the mouth of the gulch only a few
moments after Darrel had ridden into it. Had Frank
encountered Darrel, there is no doubt but that he would
have persuaded him against going on to Camp Hawtrey.
In that event, some very pretty maneuvers of Fate, calculated
to benefit Darrel, would have been effectually
blocked.</p>

<p>But Merry and his two friends missed their new chum
by a scant margin, and galloped on to Dolliver’s. Dolliver,
smoking his short black pipe, was sitting in front
of his little establishment, mentally considering uncles
and nephews, and the foolishness of a kid with a broken
arm trying to take a horseback ride before he was well
able to be out of bed.</p>

<p>At sight of Merriwell, Ballard, and Clancy, Dolliver’s
reflections went off at a fresh angle. He now began to
concern himself with the contrariness of human affairs
in general.</p>

<p>“Hello, Dolliver!” Frank called, pulling in his black
mount, Borak. “How’s Curly?”</p>

<p>“Plumb locoed,” grunted the rancher.</p>

<p>“You don’t mean to say he’s out of his head?” gasped
Frank.</p>

<p>“If he ain’t, then, by the jumpin’ hocus-pocus, I never
see a feller that was.”</p>

<p>“We’ll have to see about this!”</p>

<p>Frank slid from the saddle and started hurriedly into
the house.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_216">216</span></p>

<p>“No use lookin’ fer him in the wikiup, Merriwell,”
said Dolliver, “kase he ain’t there.”</p>

<p>“Not in the house?” demanded Frank, recoiling in
amazement. “Where is he, then?”</p>

<p>“Gone to Camp Hawtrey to make the old kunnel talk
with him.”</p>

<p>“What do you know about that!” exclaimed Ballard.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” cried the astounded Clancy.</p>

<p>“How long since he left here?” asked Frank.</p>

<p>“Less’n half an hour.”</p>

<p>“Did he ride?”</p>

<p>“Sartain he did. No more business on a hoss than a
two-year-old kid, nuther. He’s wuss to manage than a
case o’ the measles, anyways. Howsumever, he would
go. He reckoned he could talk with the kunnel and
smooth things out fer you.”</p>

<p>“How did he know matters had to be smoothed out
for me?”</p>

<p>“Bleeker and Hotchkiss dropped in here on their way
to the Hill, and they cut loose about your troubles. That
got Darrel all het up. Right arter dinner, to-day, the
kunnel himself blowed in here and tried to git Mr. Bradlaugh
on the telephone. But Bradlaugh was away on
business, I reckon. I wasn’t in the shack at the time,
but I heerd the kunnel sayin’ the business was important
and that he’d call up later this afternoon. Darrel was
in the house, though, and tried to powwow with the
kunnel, but the kunnel wouldn’t have it. Runnin’ out,
the kunnel climbed his hoss and moseyed up the cañon.
Nothin’ ’u’d do but Darrel had to mosey arter him.”</p>

<p>“Here’s news, fellows, and no mistake!” breathed Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Curly wasn’t able to take such a ride,” growled Ballard,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_217">217</span>
“and that’s a cinch.”</p>

<p>“What does he think he can do, anyhow?” asked
Clancy. “He’s not on the colonel’s visiting list.”</p>

<p>“Have you any idea what he intended to do, Dolliver?”
Merry went on.</p>

<p>“Palaver with that grouchy old uncle o’ his,” replied
the rancher. “Jode’s tryin’ to make the kunnel believe
Darrel set you up to act like you done. I allow that
Darrel wants to disabuse his mind, thinkin’ that if he’s
out o’ it you’ll have less trouble comin’ to an understandin’
with Hawtrey.”</p>

<p>“Foolish!” muttered Merriwell. “He couldn’t make
the colonel believe any such thing, and it wouldn’t help
if he could. I wish we’d get here in time to head Darrel
off. What’ll happen to him when he gets to Camp
Hawtrey?”</p>

<p>“I don’t opine he’ll ever git there,” and Dolliver shook
his head dubiously. “He wa’n’t able to sit a hoss, not
noways.”</p>

<p>Frank hurried to Borak and leaped into the saddle.</p>

<p>“Only one thing to do, fellows,” he announced, “and
that’s for us to ride for Camp Hawtrey.”</p>

<p>“Bully!” exulted the red-headed chap. “That gang
will sure welcome us with open arms.”</p>

<p>“They will that,” agreed Dolliver. “Say, if you go
to the kunnel’s camp, jest now, ye’ll have the time o’
your lives.”</p>

<p>“All right,” answered Frank, “I don’t care how hot
a time they give us providing we can do something to
help Darrel. Come on, fellows!”</p>

<p>He pointed Borak for the mouth of the cañon, and set
off at speed. Clancy and Ballard made after him.</p>

<p>The cañon trail was narrow and the riders were
obliged to proceed in single file. When they turned<span class="pagenum" id="Page_218">218</span>
into the gulch, however, they were able to ride stirrup to
stirrup.</p>

<p>“I don’t like the prospect a little bit,” said Frank.
“Now that Bleeker and Hotch have left the Gold Hill
camp, there isn’t a fellow there that’s at all friendly
toward Darrel.”</p>

<p>“Hawtrey’s there,” suggested Ballard. “Don’t forget
that, Chip. Hawtrey won’t have anything to do with
Curly, but you can bet he won’t let Jode rough things
up with him.”</p>

<p>“That’s right, Pink. Darrel must be a little hazy in
his mind to start for the Gold Hill camp at such a
time as this.”</p>

<p>“He’s trying to do you a good turn, Chip,” suggested
Clancy.</p>

<p>“Sure he is—I give him credit for that—but the crazy
old lobster can’t do me any good, or himself, either. He
ought to stay in the house for another week yet.”</p>

<p>“Bosh!” returned Clancy. “Curly is all rawhide and
India rubber. A broken wing hadn’t ought to bother
him much more than a mild case of the mumps. You’ll
notice we haven’t run across him lying along the road.”</p>

<p>“He’ll stick it out, you can bank on that,” said Ballard.
“He’s probably in Camp Hawtrey this minute.
That bunch would be pretty yellow if they didn’t treat
him right.”</p>

<p>Clancy had a sudden thought.</p>

<p>“Say, Chip,” said he, “we’re taking this hike to help
Curly, but I don’t think we’ll do him much good if we
plunge full tilt into the camp. They’re a suspicious lot,
and they might think it a frame-up of Curly’s. Suppose
we reconnoiter a little before we show ourselves?”</p>

<p>“How’ll we reconnoiter, Clan?” asked Merry.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_219">219</span></p>

<p>“The top of the gulch wall, about where we were
yesterday, is a good place for that.”</p>

<p>“I guess you’ve got the right end of the stick, Clan.
If we’re to climb the bank we’d better begin right here.
Strikes me this is as good a place as we’ll find, and it’s
far enough this side of the camp so we can make the
climb without being seen.”</p>

<p>The slope was not steep, but it was easier for the
boys to walk up the incline and lead their horses. In
perhaps ten minutes they had reached the crest, and were
able to take a comprehensive survey of the gulch below.</p>

<p>“Jove!” exclaimed Merry. “There are two fellows
on a bowlder down there. See them? They are just
below that chaparral of mesquite. One of them looks
like the colonel to me. Wonder if the other is Darrel?”</p>

<p>“Not on your life!” murmured Clancy. “The other
is Jode.”</p>

<p>“Sure enough!” agreed Ballard. “We’d better lead
our horses back from the rim, and drop down on the
rocks. If the colonel and Jode happened to look up
here, they’d see us.”</p>

<p>Ballard’s suggestion was carried out at once; then,
on their knees, the lads continued to peer downward.
Presently the colonel and Jode got up and began climbing.
They passed well to the left of the chaparral,
angled across the face of the slope, and stepped upon
a ledge that jutted out from the gulch side.</p>

<p>“I’m next to what’s going on down there,” said Merry.
“Remember what Bleek told us, Clan, when I asked him
where Jode got that dynamite for the cartridge?”</p>

<p>“He said something about Hawtrey stumbling on a
‘prospect,’” was the answer, “and that Jode was to fill
a hole, and the colonel was to load it and set it off.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_220">220</span></p>
<p>“That’s what the colonel is about to do. Let’s move
down the gulch a little way and find a place directly over
the ledge.”</p>

<p>A hundred yards carried the boys to a spot above the
ledge. Masses of splintered granite and loose bowlders
covered the slope between the ledge and the crest of the
gulch wall. The boys were able to look over the intervening
rocks, however, and get a clear view of the
ledge level.</p>

<p>Colonel Hawtrey, on his knees, was at work capping a
fuse and ramming dynamite into the hole where the
blast was to be set off.</p>

<p>“You’re right about it, Chip,” said Clancy. “The
colonel’s going to have a little blow-up, down there, and
probably he’ll make a ‘strike.’ How many poor prospectors,
do you suppose, have passed that ‘prospect’ by?
That’s the way things work out, in this world. Here’s
the colonel, with more mines and money than he knows
what to do with, just falling right over a good thing.
Now——”</p>

<p>“Look!” broke in Ballard, grabbing Frank’s arm and
pointing downward and to the left of the ledge. “See
that long break in the gulch wall, running from the
top right down to that bunch of chaparral? Who’s that
looking out of it?”</p>

<p>“Darrel!” murmured Merriwell, astounded.</p>

<p>“Curly, as sure as you’re a foot high!” fluttered Clancy.
“Now, what the deuce do you suppose he’s up to?”</p>

<p>It was a surprising situation, and no mistake. Darrel,
screened in the rift, was cautiously looking out and keeping
track of the movements of the colonel and Jode.</p>

<p>“Curly wants to talk with the colonel,” said Frank,
after a moment’s thought, “and he’s waiting for Jode
to get out of the way.”</p>

<p>“I could slip down that chute,” suggested Ballard, “and<span class="pagenum" id="Page_221">221</span>
slide right into Darrel. We could bring him up here,
with us, and——”</p>

<p>“Wait till after the blast,” cut in Merry. “The
colonel’s just touching it off.”</p>

<p>“See Jode scramble for the tall rocks!” chuckled
Clancy. “He’s not going to take any chances on being
knocked over by flying stones.”</p>

<p>“Neither is Curly,” added Ballard. “He has ducked
down into the bottom of that hole of his.”</p>

<p>“Two sticks of dynamite will lift a pretty big chunk
out of that ledge,” said Merriwell, “and before it lets go
we’d better push back a little. The charge——”</p>

<p>The words died on Merry’s lips. A bowlder, just
above the ledge, had slipped from its moorings and was
rolling over and over, grinding and crashing toward
the ledge. The colonel had just risen from lighting the
fuse. He saw the bowlder, and tried frantically to get
out of the way of it. In his haste, he slipped and fell
prone upon the ledge. The next moment the bowlder
was upon him!</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXIV" id="CHAPTER_XXXIV">CHAPTER XXXIV.</a><br />

<small>A TANGLE OF EVENTS.</small></h2>


<p>Right from that moment a series of thrilling happenings
began below. The slope of the gulch wall was a
stage, and from the crest Frank and his chums watched
events breathlessly. Horror gripped them and held them
spellbound. Instinctively they rose from their crouching
positions and stared wide-eyed at the tragic scene below
them.</p>

<p>The colonel, as it is already known, had cut off only a
two-minute length of fuse. This meant that, in one
hundred and twenty seconds from the time he applied
the match to the fuse, the gulch wall adjacent to the
ledge would be piled with ruin. So, in the short space
of two minutes, one weird event heaped itself upon
another with amazing rapidity.</p>

<p>Frank and his chums saw it all. Not one detail of
the awful drama escaped them. But, as the eye can
comprehend infinitely quicker than the tongue can frame
a scene in so many words, it will be well to describe each
occurrence. At the same time, let it be remembered that
most of them happened simultaneously, and that the
others fairly jostled each other, so closely did they
follow.</p>

<p>It was the falling bowlder that, primarily, caused the
tragic situation. This had become loosened, perhaps by
the pounding Jode had done in “putting down” that hole
for the blast. Poised and ready to tumble, Fate held
the bowlder back until the critical moment when the
colonel had lighted his two-minute fuse and was on the
point of rushing from the ledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_223">223</span></p>

<p>A cry of horror escaped the lads on the crest when
they saw the huge stone apparently about to crush out
the life of the fallen man on the ledge. But fortune, in
a small way, favored Colonel Hawtrey.</p>

<p>The bowlder crashed to a full stop on the ledge, trapping
one of the colonel’s feet. He was held securely,
it seemed, for, in spite of his wild struggles, he could
not release himself.</p>

<p>He was lying on the stones with his head toward the
sputtering fuse, and yet the fuse itself was well beyond
the reach of his arms. A terrible fate appeared to be
in store for him unless Jode came to his rescue.</p>

<p>The colonel, of course, knew nothing about Darrel
being close at hand, so his frantic cries were all directed
at Jode.</p>

<p>“Jode!” he shouted. “I’m trapped by a bowlder!
Hurry, and tear away the fuse! Jode! Do you hear
me?”</p>

<p>At just this moment, when Jode’s presence was so
urgently demanded by the colonel, another factor had
come bounding into the weird progress of events. The
coyote dog had been skulking among the rocks above
the ledge. The roar of the falling bowlder had frightened
the animal, and he had uttered a wild yelp and
started for the top of the gulch wall. Before he reached
the crest, he saw Frank and his chums, and whirled and
dashed down the slope. His course carried him among
the bowlders where Jode had sought refuge from the
débris of the blast.</p>

<p>And now, under the colonel’s own eyes, Jode Lenning
gave abundant proof of the “yellow streak” in his character.
He saw the tawny form of the outcast dog leaping
toward him, eyes gleaming, mouth open, and red
tongue protruding. Fear seized Jode, for no doubt he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_224">224</span>
believed in the superstition that was held by many of
the settlers in those parts, and felt in his soul that the
dog was rushing upon him in a vengeful mood.</p>

<p>The frantic shouts of the colonel passed over Jode’s
head unheeded. The colonel might be in danger, but
Jode was obsessed with the idea that his own danger was
fully as great. So, why should he think of his uncle
when his own life swung in the balance?</p>

<p>This must have been the trend of Lenning’s reasoning.
With a cry of fear, he rushed out from among the rocks
and raced for the trail at the foot of the gulch wall.</p>

<p>As a matter of fact, the coyote dog had no designs
whatever upon Jode. All the animal was trying to do
was to efface himself from the scene as quickly as possible.
Very likely, he was more anxious to get away
from Jode than Jode was to get away from him.</p>

<p>Howling for help, stumbling, and falling, and rolling,
Jode put forth every effort to reach the bottom of the
slope. Long before he had accomplished his purpose,
the coyote dog had passed him on an angling course and
had flickered away down the gulch. Jode, in his excitement,
failed to notice this. He had the impression
that the enraged brute was still on his trail, and did not
slacken his pace.</p>

<p>Colonel Hawtrey, lying helpless on the ledge with the
flame of the fuse dancing nearer and nearer to the charge
of dynamite, was able to watch his nephew flying down
the slope. In that tense moment the boy’s whole nature
must have revealed itself to the colonel in a single flash.</p>

<p>Merriwell had not remained long inactive on the crest
of the sloping bank. As soon as it became evident that
nothing could be expected from Jode, he flung himself
among the masses of bowlders and splintered rocks and
began a descent toward the ledge.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_225">225</span></p>

<p>But the going was difficult, and Merriwell realized,
with a sinking heart, that it would be impossible for him
to reach the ledge before the charge of dynamite had exploded.
Then, at the very moment the realization came
home to him, he saw Darrel pawing and scrambling over
the rocks toward his uncle.</p>

<p>A hopeful thought plunged through Merriwell’s brain.
A light dawned upon him suddenly. Here was the very
chance for which Ellis Darrel had been waiting. Fate
had taken his affairs in hand, and, in a short two minutes
of time, was revealing to the colonel the varying
dispositions of his two nephews.</p>

<p>The one who, up to that moment, had had all
Hawtrey’s affection and confidence, was bounding and
plunging down the slope and abandoning him to his fate.
The other, the lad that had been cast adrift and had
been looked upon as a ne’er-do-well and a forger, was
struggling valiantly to reach his uncle’s side and extinguish
the blazing fuse.</p>

<p>There was danger in Darrel’s attempt. He was handicapped
in his work because of his useless arm, and he
had not a second to spare if he gained the ledge in time.
If he failed to reach the ledge before the fuse exploded
the cap and the cap set off the dynamite, then not only
his uncle but he himself would be killed by the blast.</p>

<p>Darrel must have understood this, yet it made not
the slightest difference to him. Furiously he was fighting
his way over the rough ground toward the ledge.
Again and again he stumbled and fell. His broken arm
surely received many an agonizing wrench, but physical
pain was as powerless to hold him back as was the
prospect of death from his failure to reach the sputtering
fuse in time.</p>

<p>Colonel Hawtrey at last became aware that some one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_226">226</span>
else was coming to his rescue. He turned and, with
glimmering eyes, watched the fierce efforts of Darrel.
The boy’s face was white and haggard, but the same
resolution smoldered in his eyes that had fixed itself
there when he had left Dolliver’s.</p>

<p>The colonel was calm, now. The old military spirit
revived in him, and he turned calculating eyes upon the
fuse and measured at a glance the space that separated
Darrel from the ledge.</p>

<p>“Stop where you are, El!” the colonel called, commandingly.
“You can’t get here in time. If you keep
on, two lives instead of one will be lost. Turn back, I
tell you!”</p>

<p>Darrel did not answer. Neither did he turn back.
He held to his course. There was a smear of red on
the bandage that swathed the arm, but he continued to
fight his way onward.</p>

<p>As a mere exhibition of pluck, the boy’s work was
splendid. But what he was doing reached deeper, and
something like admiration filled the colonel’s face as he
watched. He tried no longer to make Darrel turn back.
Possibly he knew any command of his would be useless.</p>

<p>Jode could be seen at the bottom of the slope. He
had at last discovered that the coyote dog was no longer
at his heels. Standing in the trail, he looked upward,
and, like Frank and his chums, and the colonel, witnessed
the gallant struggle his half brother was making.</p>

<p>The work Darrel was doing should have been Lenning’s.
That fact could not escape the boy at the foot
of the slope. What his thoughts were, in the circumstances,
may easily be imagined.</p>

<p>“Good work, Curly!” shouted Merriwell.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_227">227</span> “You’ll
make it, old man!”</p>

<p>This encouragement, coming in Merriwell’s familiar
voice, probably carried a big surprise for Darrel. He
had no time for surprises, however. Close to the ledge,
he flung himself over at full length upon the stones and
reached for the fuse.</p>

<p>The blaze had eaten its way to the very mouth of the
drilled hole. Darrel dug down into the aperture with
his fingers, searing his flesh as he pinched out the fire;
then, with a stifled groan, he fell over on his back and
lay silent and still.</p>

<p>“We’ll be with you in a minute, colonel,” shouted
Frank cheerily, once more beginning to descend. “Darrel
has prevented a blow-up, and now everything is going
to be all right.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” came from the colonel, in a strained voice that
was none too steady, “you’re right about that, Merriwell.
I’ll make it my business to see that everything
is all right—for Ellis.”</p>

<p>Clancy and Ballard had likewise started down the
side of the gulch wall. A tremendous relief had been
experienced by both the boys when they had seen Darrel
reach the fuse.</p>

<p>“We’ll be down there in a brace of shakes, Chip,”
sang out Clancy as he saw Merriwell step to the ledge
and move toward the colonel.</p>

<p>Frank was kneeling beside Darrel when Clancy and
Ballard reached the ledge.</p>

<p>“Never mind me, Merriwell.” Clancy and Ballard heard
the colonel say, “I’m doing well enough for the present.
Just look after Darrel, will you?”</p>

<p>“Is he hurt, Chip?” asked Ballard.</p>

<p>“He wasn’t in any shape to make a fight like that,”
Merry answered,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_228">228</span> “and it took the ginger all out of him.
He’s fainted, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“One of you go down to the bottom of the gulch
and get a little water,” directed the colonel.</p>

<p>“Curly will be all right, sir,” said Frank, “until we
get that bowlder off you. Strikes me that you’re in a
pretty bad situation.”</p>

<p>“It only seems to be a bad situation. As it happens,
there’s a crevice in the bowlder where it rests upon my
foot and leg. I’m pinioned here, but I don’t believe I
have been injured at all.”</p>

<p>With a steel drill for a lever, Frank pried carefully
at the big stone while Clancy and Ballard put their combined
weight against it. Their efforts were successful
and the bowlder was rolled away.</p>

<p>The colonel pulled himself together and sat up on the
ledge.</p>

<p>“That was a close call for me,” he remarked coolly,
“and for Ellis, too. Do you think you could carry him
down to the water?”</p>

<p>“Easily,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>All three of the boys laid hold of Darrel, gathered
him up in their arms and started carefully down the
slope. The colonel followed, limping a little as he came.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXV" id="CHAPTER_XXXV">CHAPTER XXXV.</a><br />

<small>A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS.</small></h2>


<p>Lenning had disappeared from the foot of the slope
by the time the little party from above had brought their
burden to the water’s edge. It was just as well for all
concerned that he had not lingered.</p>

<p>Darrel was laid down with a rolled-up coat under
his head for a pillow. The boys scooped up water in
their hands and allowed it to trickle over the white,
unconscious face.</p>

<p>“That was about as nervy a piece of work as I ever
saw a fellow do,” remarked Clancy, on his knees at Darrel’s
side.</p>

<p>“That’s the sort of a chap Curly is,” spoke up Ballard.</p>

<p>“You’re right, Pink,” said Merriwell shortly.</p>

<p>The colonel’s face was a study. Not much could be
learned from it, however, regarding the state of his
feelings.</p>

<p>“How is it,” he asked, “that all of you happened
to be around at the time I needed help? Did you
and your friends come with Ellis, Merriwell?”</p>

<p>“We followed him,” Merry answered.</p>

<p>“Followed him?” echoed the other.</p>

<p>“Why, you see,” Merry explained,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_230">230</span> “we started for
Dolliver’s soon after you left Tinaja Wells, colonel.
From what you said, I gathered the impression that you
believed Darrel had something to do with the way
Clancy and I lit into Lenning, on account of that coyote
dog. I was afraid he’d hear of it, and I wanted to
talk the matter over with him. Besides, I had it in
mind to call up Mr. Bradlaugh on the phone from Dolliver’s,
and tell him how matters were getting complicated.”</p>

<p>“I tried that myself,” said the colonel, “but discovered
that Mr. Bradlaugh was out of town.” “Perhaps it’s
just as well I couldn’t talk with him,” he added.</p>

<p>“When we reached Dolliver’s,” Frank resumed, “we
were told that Darrel had left to go to Camp Hawtrey.
I didn’t stop to telephone, but turned and followed him!”</p>

<p>“Why did Ellis start for our camp?”</p>

<p>“He wanted to talk with you—to try and patch up our
differences on account of what happened yesterday.”</p>

<p>“Just an errand of his own out of mere friendship for
you, eh?”</p>

<p>“That’s about the size of it, sir.”</p>

<p>“What did you follow him for?”</p>

<p>“Well,” said Frank bluntly, “I wasn’t sure how he’d
be treated at Camp Hawtrey. And then, too, I thought
it was foolish of him to try and get you to change your
mind regarding me.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” A queer smile crossed the colonel’s face as
he bent down to rub the knee that had lately been
pinned under the bowlder. “You didn’t have much confidence,”
he finished, “in my ideas of fair play?”</p>

<p>“Not when you were banking on information furnished
by Jode. I couldn’t——”</p>

<p>“Darrel’s coming around, Chip,” broke in Clancy.</p>

<p>Merriwell stepped close to Darrel’s side. The lad’s
eyes were open and he was staring up into the faces that
bent over him.</p>

<p>“Gee, what a mix-up!” were Darrel’s first words. “I
must have stepped out for a few minutes, I reckon.
Who sic’d that coyote dog on Jode?”</p>

<p>“The dog was among the rocks, Curly,” Frank an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_231">231</span>swered.
“When the bowlder fell, it scared him out.
He tried to get over the top of the gulch wall, but Pink,
Clan, and I were there, and so he whirled and rushed for
the place where Lenning was holed up. How do you
feel?”</p>

<p>“I feel as though I’d been too darned ambitious for a
sick man. What the dickens are you doing here, anyway?”</p>

<p>Clancy chuckled.</p>

<p>“We just moseyed along behind you to try and keep
you out of trouble,” he laughed. “And we didn’t make
out.”</p>

<p>“You followed me from Dolliver’s?”</p>

<p>“Surest thing you know. You were batty to even
think of going to the Gold Hill camp. Chip fretted
about that, and we all started after you.”</p>

<p>“Well, well!” Darrel changed his position a little and
then wriggled into a sitting posture. “Was the colonel
hurt?”</p>

<p>“No, my lad,” said the colonel, stepping closer and
speaking for himself. “I’m all right, thanks to you.
You reached the fuse just in the nick of time, although
I’d have sworn you couldn’t make it. What did you
mean by disregarding my orders to turn back?”</p>

<p>“I wasn’t caring a whoop about orders,” said Darrel.
“If you gave any I don’t believe I heard them,
anyhow. I know I pinched out the fire, but what I
was wondering was whether you had been hurt by that
bowlder.”</p>

<p>The colonel explained how he had escaped injury
from the falling rock.</p>

<p>“I’m afraid,” he added, “that you’ve done that arm
of yours little good by this day’s work. If you feel<span class="pagenum" id="Page_232">232</span>
able, you might come along to the camp with me. We
can make you comfortable there, and——”</p>

<p>Darrel shook his head.</p>

<p>“I’m obliged to you, colonel,” he answered, “but I
reckon Dolliver’s is the best place for me for a while.”</p>

<p>“You’re able to ride back there?”</p>

<p>“Yes, and with ground to spare.”</p>

<p>The colonel came closer and stood over Darrel.</p>

<p>“Do you want to shake hands with me?” he asked.</p>

<p>The boy flushed. “I want to,” he answered, “but I’m
not going to until—until I can read my title clear. You
know what I mean, colonel.”</p>

<p>“I think so,” was Hawtrey’s answer, and it was not
difficult for Frank to see that the stern old man was
pleased.</p>

<p>“I’d like to ask one thing of you, sir,” Darrel went
on.</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Why, that you’ll take Merriwell’s word as to what
happened near Camp Hawtrey yesterday afternoon. If
you knew him as well as I do, colonel, you wouldn’t
hesitate a minute.”</p>

<p>“I don’t think,” answered the colonel dryly, “that I
shall hesitate quite so much as I did yesterday afternoon.
I’ll come over to Tinaja Wells this evening, Merriwell,”
he finished, turning to Frank, “and then I will
have something to add to our interesting conference of
this afternoon. Good-by, Darrel! Good-by, my lads.”</p>

<p>The colonel turned and limped off up the gulch in
the direction of Camp Hawtrey. He was hardly out of
sight before Merriwell stooped down and caught Darrel
by the hand.</p>

<p>“Old man,” said he heartily,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_233">233</span> “you’ve made a big winning
this afternoon. If we’d manufactured the thing to
order it could not have turned out better. The old
colonel had a chance to strike a balance between you
and Jode. His eyes have been opened, and he has seen
for himself just what sort of a fellow Jode is.”</p>

<p>“It happened just about right, that’s a fact,” returned
Darrel. “The old boy has had a hard blow, but you’d
never know it to look at him. That’s his way.”</p>

<p>“That picture he saw of Jode, neck-and-necking it
down the hill with the coyote dog,” laughed Clancy,
“will live in his memory a good long while.”</p>

<p>“What will he say to Jode?” queried Ballard. “I’d
like to be around and hear it.”</p>

<p>“No one can ever tell what the colonel will do,” said
Darrel. “Jode, I reckon, will have a hard time explaining
why he ran down the hill when he ought to have been
yanking that blazing fuse out by the roots.”</p>

<p>“We’d better be starting back to Dolliver’s,” put in
Merry. “Where’s your horse, Curly?”</p>

<p>Darrel told where the horse had been left. While
Merriwell went after it, Clancy and Ballard climbed the
slope to get the three mounts that had been left on top
of the gulch wall.</p>

<p>Half an hour afterward all the boys were riding down
the gulch, en route to Dolliver’s. They formed about the
happiest party that had ever traveled that particular
trail. There had been a rift in the black clouds of
injustice and suspicion that had hung for so long above
Darrel’s head, and through the rift the sun of hope was
shining. Darrel’s luck had taken a sudden turn for the
better.</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVI" id="CHAPTER_XXXVI">CHAPTER XXXVI.</a><br />

<small>A CHANGE OF MIND.</small></h2>


<p>As soon as the boys reached Dolliver’s, they put Darrel
to bed and sent in a telephone call for the doctor.
Mr. Bradlaugh was back in town, and he brought the
doctor out in his automobile. While an examination was
being made to see whether Darrel’s arm had suffered
any from the exciting events of the afternoon, Merriwell
was out at the car, going over all the details of the affair
for Mr. Bradlaugh’s benefit.</p>

<p>Merry began at the beginning, and that means, of
course, that he had to start with the coyote dog and the
dynamite cartridge. When he had finished, the president
of the Ophir Athletic Club was breathing a little
harder than usual.</p>

<p>“That’s a most remarkable story, Merriwell,” said
he, “and the most remarkable part of it, to my mind, is
the way Hawtrey let that pesky nephew of his make a
fool of him. He’d call off the football game, would he,
just because Jode Lenning happened to get into a scrap
with you! Wonder if he thinks that’s good sportsmanship?
I wish to thunder he’d got me on the phone and
told me about this himself. Say, maybe I wouldn’t have
read the riot act to him.”</p>

<p>“The colonel has woke up, Mr. Bradlaugh,” laughed
Merry, “and I’ll bet Jode’s about at the end of his string.”</p>

<p>“Let me know what Hawtrey says to you when he
calls at the Wells this evening,” said Mr. Bradlaugh.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_235">235</span> “I
think he knows a whole lot more now than he did
earlier in the afternoon, but he’s a queer proposition, and
you never can tell what he’s going to do. If he’s still
a bit offish, I’ll make it a point to see him myself.”</p>

<p>“What do you think about the way we mixed things
with Lenning on account of the dog?”</p>

<p>“If you hadn’t mixed things with him,” laughed Mr.
Bradlaugh, “you’d have had a chance to mix things with
me. Plain brutality to a dumb brute,” he went on,
straightening his face, “is more than I’ll take from any
man.”</p>

<p>The doctor reported that Darrel’s arm had not been
injured materially by the rough usage it had had during
the afternoon, but the owner of the arm was warned
to stay in bed for several days and not to try any horseback
exercise until given permission to do so.</p>

<p>Darrel was in a more cheerful frame of mind, when
Frank and his chums left, than he had been in for many
a long day. He had accomplished something for himself,
and he knew that he would accomplish more. Best
of all, he had saved the colonel.</p>

<p>It was late when Merriwell, Clancy, and Ballard got
back to Tinaja Wells. Handy and Brad were anxiously
awaiting their arrival.</p>

<p>“The boys have got wind of something, Chip,” said
Handy, “and they’re all up in the air. I think we’d
better break camp and go in to town.”</p>

<p>“I think so, too,” said Merry. “We ought to have a
week’s work on the home field before the game with
Gold Hill.”</p>

<p>“Why,” spoke up Brad, “I thought that was all off.”</p>

<p>“So it was,” laughed Merriwell, “but I’ve got a hunch
that it will be on again before long.”</p>

<p>During supper he repeated for the Ophir lads the
same account that he had given to Mr. Bradlaugh at
Dolliver’s. As might have been expected, the recital<span class="pagenum" id="Page_236">236</span>
was greeted with delight by all the campers, and the
demonstration wound up with a volley of cheers for
Ellis Darrel.</p>

<p>It was quite fitting, perhaps, that Colonel Hawtrey
should arrive at Tinaja Wells during the cheering. As
he strode through the half gloom and into the light of
the cook fire, he pulled off his hat and waved it about
his gray head.</p>

<p>“You’re cheering my nephew, Ellis Darrel,” he shouted,
“and I reckon I ought to be allowed to join in. Now
that you’re done with Darrel, why not give three rousers
for Merriwell? Come on, boys, all together!”</p>

<p>With that, the cañon fairly rang with a hearty three
times three and a tiger. When silence finally settled
over the camp, the colonel, still keeping his hat in his
hand and his place by the fire, made a brief address
to the Ophir fellows:</p>

<p>“I have come here this evening,” said he, “for the
purpose of apologizing to Merriwell. I misjudged him,
and because of that I crowded him pretty hard in a
talk I had with him early in the afternoon. He took it
well, and didn’t pitch into me. I suppose,” and the
speaker laughed, “that he kept hands off on account of
my gray hairs.</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_237">237</span></p>
<p>“During our conversation, if I remember, I told Merriwell
that there would be no further competitions between
the Gold Hill and the Ophir athletic organizations,
and I declared, in pretty strong terms, that there’d be
no football game next Thanksgiving Day. Well, I’ve
changed my mind about that. The two clubs are going
to meet and mingle in all the contests the games committees
can arrange for. And we’re going to act like
true sportsmen, every one of us, just as the chip of the
old block has acted during his trouble on account of the
coyote dog. ‘Fair play and no favor,’ that’s the idea,
and we’ll stand up to it as firmly as Merriwell has done.
I reckon that will be all.”</p>

<p>Clancy started the cheering for Colonel Hawtrey, and
when it was done, all the campers flocked around the
colonel and shook him by the hand.</p>

<p>“It’s a great day for Ellis Darrel, Clan,” said Merry
to his red-headed chum.</p>

<p>“It’s a great day for everybody, Chip,” answered
Clan, “and especially for true sportsmanship between the
clubs.”</p>

<p>“A great day for everybody,” qualified Billy Ballard,
“except Jode Lenning.”</p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XXXVII" id="CHAPTER_XXXVII">CHAPTER XXXVII.</a><br />

<small>A MATTER OF THIRTY DOLLARS.</small></h2>


<p>“Pink, this is awful!”</p>

<p>Young Merriwell turned a gloomy face toward his
chum, Billy Ballard, who sat beside him in the grand
stand. Ballard fell back with a groan.</p>

<p>“Awful, but true, Chip,” he answered. “After all
the grinding, gruelling work of the last few weeks, the
regular eleven can’t any more than hold their own against
the scrubs. What’s got into the bunch?”</p>

<p>The scene was that part of the Ophir Athletic Club
field which lay directly in front of the grand stand and
contained the gridiron. Two teams were sweating and
struggling with the pigskin—regulars against the second-string
men. The first half was drawing to a close. There
had been no scoring. The scrubs, playing like fiends,
were meeting the regulars at every point and holding them
in a most humiliating way.</p>

<p>The regulars were just back from three weeks of hard
practice in the camp at Tinaja Wells. This was the
first game since their return to town, and the first of
the preliminary matches which Merry had arranged previous
to the big game with Ophir’s old and successful
rival: Gold Hill.</p>

<p>Merriwell had been looking forward to a fortnight of
fine sport, in which the regulars would distinguish themselves
in battles with the scrubs and with a cowboy eleven
from the Bar Z Ranch, gradually rounding themselves
into a harmonious machine which Gold Hill would find
invincible. Frank had fondly imagined that the team he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_239">239</span>
had drilled so thoroughly and so conscientiously would
go through the remaining two weeks’ of practice in a
beautiful romp, piling point upon point in each preliminary
skirmish, and going through its less experienced
opponents with the ease and finish of veterans. But what
he saw that afternoon, from the moment the ball had
been put in play, had made him gasp and rub his eyes.</p>

<p>There was no doubt about it, that cherished team had
bounced upon a reef. It had started in on the despised
scrub with a sort of pitying contempt, evidently planning
to exercise restraint and not make too many touchdowns
or kick too many goals. And what had it found? Nothing
less than a bunch of wild cats, playing to win in a
perfect fury of determination, and shaking out the most
unexpected tricks from a bag which no one dreamed
they possessed.</p>

<p>Frank was more than pleased with the way the scrubs
were distinguishing themselves, and more than amazed
at the sorry exhibition the regulars were making. The
scrubs, for the most part, had remained in town while
the club team had been off in Mohave Cañon, training
for battle every day and going through a course of
sprouts calculated to make each and every member a
finished performer.</p>

<p>And now, the result!</p>

<p>In less than five minutes from the kick-off the regulars
had lost their contempt for the scrubs. They awoke to
a realization that, in some mysterious fashion, the scrubs
had been transformed into a little army of brawn and
brain—foemen in every way worth of their mettle.</p>

<p>The regulars tried, in a spasm of pique after the
Spartan nature of their fight dawned on their minds, to
rush the scrubs off the field. But the scrubs wouldn’t
be rushed. The regulars gritted their teeth and tried<span class="pagenum" id="Page_240">240</span>
harder. Still nothing doing. A great disappointment
took hold of Merry, and he turned to Ballard and put
it in the fewest possible words.</p>

<p>Only Merriwell and Ballard were in the grand stand.
Under the stand there were dressing rooms for visiting
players, and into one of these rooms there had come by
stealth a young man with sinister face and evil and
greedy eyes. At a distance of ten or fifteen feet from
the two lads in the stand, the interloper was peering out
from between two board seats, watching the ragged performance
of the regular Ophir team and listening to the
gloomy remarks that passed between Merry and Ballard.
A self-satisfied grin crossed the face of the keen-eyed,
keen-eared youth.</p>

<p>That game—and Merriwell was glad in his heart that
it was so—was strictly private. The general public was
barred.</p>

<p>Had grand stand and bleachers been thrown open
to spectators, emissaries from Gold Hill might have
crept in to watch for vulnerable points in the work of
the Ophir team. For years Gold Hill had been a winner
in its games with Ophir, and was ever on the alert for
advantages that would help to prevent a slip from its
enviable record.</p>

<p>This prowler under the benches, chuckling over the
disappointment of the Ophir coach and the ragged work
of the Ophir team, was not there for any good. But for
his own daring and ingenuity and unscrupulousness, he
would not have been there at all.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” muttered Merriwell. “Why, Pink, the
team isn’t playing half so well as it did in that little practice
game with Gold Hill, on the mesa at Tinaja Wells!”</p>

<p>“It doesn’t look like the same team, Chip,” replied<span class="pagenum" id="Page_241">241</span>
Ballard. “What’s got into them? Mayburn’s a joke
at center, Doolittle as right tackle is all that his name
implies, and Spink, at quarter, is all balled up. By
George! Say, I’ll bet a peck of prunes against a celluloid
collar that the scrubs score in the next half.”</p>

<p>“No, they won’t,” gritted Merriwell. He was on his
feet, taking personal odds and ends from his trouser’s
pockets and stowing them in his coat. At last he threw
off the coat and dropped it where he had been sitting.
“Come on, Pink,” he added, leaping over the rail and
into the field, “you and I have got to get into this.”</p>

<p>The first half was over. Clancy, who was acting as
referee, was walking up and down the side lines, telling
the sweating club eleven what he thought of them. Merriwell
stopped him and did a little talking on his own account.
Handy, the captain, seemed utterly demoralized
and in a daze. Even the scrubs seemed a bit awed by
what they had accomplished.</p>

<p>Merriwell’s temper was struggling to get the best of
him. He had tried, to the best of his ability, to make
a winning team of the club eleven. But all his work
seemed to have gone for nothing. With a tremendous
effort he kept his feelings in check. The look on his
face, however, was enough for the regulars. They knew
how intense was Merriwell’s disappointment, and they
realized that they were the cause of it.</p>

<p>“You fellows have got to get together,” said Frank,
his voice low and deliberate. “You play as though it
was every fellow for himself, and seem to forget what
I have been pounding into you about teamwork. Every
man is a cog in the machine, and all the cogs have got
to work together if you don’t want the machine to go
wrong. There were times, Spink,” and he turned not
unkindly to the quarter,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_242">242</span> “when it seemed to me as though
you had paralysis of the intellect. It’s just possible that
you got rattled because Handy interfered with you. I
saw that.” He faced the captain. “I guess you got excited,
Handy,” he continued, “when you tried to tease
the scrubs and found them giving you a handful. You
know better than to mix in with the work of the quarter
back, so please restrain yourself during the next half,
Mayburn,” and he turned to that husky player, “I’m
surprised at you. For the rest of this game Ballard will
play your position and I’ll try and fill Spink’s place. It
would be fine to have the scrubs score against you,
wouldn’t it? Get on your toes and work together during
the next half, all of you. And,” he finished, with a grim
smile at the scrubs, “I want you fellows to do your best
and put it over the regulars—if you can. So far, you’ve
played a great game. Keep it up.”</p>

<p>While this talk was going forward, a hand had crept
out from between the seats in the grand stand and had
groped for Merriwell’s coat. Finding the garment, the
fingers of the hand closed on it and withdrew it from
sight. At about the time the players took they field for
the second half, the coat had been returned, and the
greedy, evil eyes were again studying the football field.</p>

<p>There was a decided improvement in the work of the
club team after Merriwell and Ballard had taken the
places of Spink and Mayburn. But there was no scoring
on the part of the regulars, for the scrubs continued
to hold them and to fight like madmen for every yard
in front of their goal posts. Most of the battling was in
scrub territory.</p>

<p>Merriwell had not retired Spink temporarily and taken
his place because the quarter back had become rattled.
What Merry wanted was to get into the game and study
at close and active quarters the unsuspected defects of<span class="pagenum" id="Page_243">243</span>
the Ophir team. All the plays were carefully directed
for this one purpose.</p>

<p>When the scoreless game was finished, the regulars
started grimly for the gymnasium with the second eleven
skylarking around them and joshing them at every step
of the way. Frank jumped into the grand stand for his
coat and Ballard’s, and then joined his chums on the
way to the bathrooms.</p>

<p>“What do you think of the performance, Chip?”
queried Clancy ruefully.</p>

<p>“I think,” was the reply, “that we’ll have to put in
several days of mighty hard work. Not only that, but
I’m going to make one or two changes in the line-up.
I——”</p>

<p>He suddenly came to a dead stop. He had been groping
in the pockets of his coat for the personal property
he had left in them. A blank look overspread his face.</p>

<p>“What’s to pay, old man?” queried Ballard.</p>

<p>“I’ve lost what money I had, somewhere,” was the
answer. “Probably it dropped out of my coat, back there
in the grand stand.”</p>

<p>“How much?” asked Clancy.</p>

<p>“A matter of thirty dollars, Clan; twenty-five in bills
and some change.”</p>

<p>Clancy whistled, and Ballard looked ominous.</p>

<p>“I don’t see how it could have dropped out,” said Ballard.
“You’re not usually so careless as all that, Chip.”</p>

<p>“It <em>must</em> have dropped out,” was the reply; “what
else could have happened?”</p>

<p>“Let’s go back and see,” said Clancy.</p>

<p>The three lads returned to the grand stand and made
a thorough search. The money was not in evidence.</p>

<p>“Maybe it fell through between the seats, Chip,” Bal<span class="pagenum" id="Page_244">244</span>lard
suggested. “Let’s go into the dressing rooms under
the place where you left your coat.”</p>

<p>There were no locks on the dressing-room doors, and
the lads made a thorough investigation but without finding
any trace of the missing money. A look of suspicion
crossed Clancy’s freckled face.</p>

<p>“A matter of thirty dollars,” said he, “can’t get up and
walk off all by itself. While the game was on, Chip,
somebody sneaked into the grand stand and went
through your pockets.”</p>

<p>“Why didn’t the fellow go through mine as well as
Chip’s?” queried Ballard. “I didn’t have any money in
my pockets, but——”</p>

<p>“That’s the reason,” said Clancy.</p>

<p>“Keep it quiet,” frowned Merriwell. “I don’t want
the Ophir fellows to think for a moment that we suspect
any one. We’ll know some time, I guess, whether the
money was lost or stolen, and just now we’ll think it’s
lost, and keep mum. Come on to the gym.”</p>

<small>MORE DISCOURAGEMENT.</small></h2>


<p>It seemed as though everything was going wrong for
Merriwell. As if the poor showing of the regular eleven,
after weeks of practice, was not sufficiently discouraging,
this loss of the thirty dollars had to happen by way of
heaping up the measure.</p>

<p>While Frank was getting his shower and his rub-down,
his thoughts were about equally divided between
the ragged work of the players and the mysterious disappearance
of the money.</p>

<p>So far as the football team was concerned, two weeks
yet remained before the game with Gold Hill, and the
young coach grimly resolved that at least ten days of the
fourteen should see such driving practice as the squad
had never known. He would change the line-up, pound
the whole machine into form, and give Ophir a winning
team in spite of fate!</p>

<p>Merry knew, from practical experience, just how much
could be accomplished in two weeks—provided a fellow
went at it hard enough. He would give the eleven a
drilling which would make the time spent at Tinaja
Wells look like a loafing bee.</p>

<p>Having made up his mind to this, the discouraging
afternoon’s work on the grid lost much of its sting.
What sting there was left, merely roweled the coach’s
determination to give Ophir a winning eleven.</p>

<p>Merry was the son of the best all-round athlete and
coach the country had ever known. That fact was universally
admitted. The lad, his white skin glowing un<span class="pagenum" id="Page_246">246</span>der
the manipulations of the Mexican rubber, felt the
old indomitable spirit tingling through his veins. He
would show them, by Jove! He would prove that he
was a chip off the old block! Down in that out-of-the-way
corner of Arizona he would lick that pioneer team
into shape—or he’d know the reason why.</p>

<p>Somehow or other, young Merriwell experienced a
glow of satisfaction. There was a fascination in overcoming
difficulties—in winning success in spite of them.
Where’s the credit if a fellow romps to victory without
any opposing hardships? It takes the hard knocks, the
glowering possibilities of failure, to put us “on our
toes” and make us buck the line of fate with a do-or-die
determination to “get there.”</p>

<p>Merry had reached that point. Hovering disaster
caused him to reach out and lay firm hold of the invincible
spirit that every lad, if he is worth his salt,
has always at the back of his nature. And this spirit
is alive with electric force. Every fellow who falls
back upon it feels a thrill in every nerve. This it was
that brought Merry his glow of satisfaction.</p>

<p>Having conquered the disturbing features of the practice
game, the lad’s thoughts turned to the loss of the
money. There was not an avaricious hair in his head,
and it was not the mere fact that he was minus thirty
dollars that bothered him; it was the ugly suspicion that
there might be a thief among some of those Ophir
fellows. He hated to think it, and it was because of
the fact that, even in thought, he did not want to do
the Ophir club an injustice, that he had warned Clancy
and Ballard to keep mum on the subject of the lost
money.</p>

<p>Oddly enough, there was a pocket piece mixed up with
the missing silver, and the most of Merry’s regret<span class="pagenum" id="Page_247">247</span>
centered about that. It was a silver half dollar, neatly
plugged, which had been “worked off” on Merry by
some one in Sandstone, Cal. When he found that the
fifty-cent piece was minted in the year of his birth, he
immediately accepted it as a souvenir. With the lapse
of time a sentimental interest had developed in the coin
and Merriwell hated to lose it.</p>

<p>By the time the regulars and the scrubs got out of
the gym, the hilarity of the second-string men had
faded. They had played a good game and, with unexpected
luck, had held the regulars. The joy aroused by
this excellent showing had manifested itself directly after
the game, but the scrubs had been doing a little reflecting
while taking their showers and getting into their clothes.</p>

<p>Every member of the O.  A.  C. was fiercely eager to
win the coming game with Gold Hill. If the club team,
after weeks of coaching, could not take a game from a
picked-up eleven, what chances would it have with Gold
Hill? This thought pushed aside the joys of the afternoon,
and filled scrubs, as well as regulars, with painful
doubts.</p>

<p>Merry emerged smiling from the bathrooms. As he
came out into the groups of players, lingering in front
of the gym, many a glum face was turned wonderingly
in his direction. What meant that sunny, confident
smile on the face of the coach? Was it possible that he
had seen anything hopeful in the afternoon’s miserable
work?</p>

<p>Hannibal Bradlaugh, son of the president of the club,
stepped up to Merry.</p>

<p>“I reckon, Chip,” said he, “that you think that this
club team is a joke. Is that what amuses you?”</p>

<p>“It’s not a joke, Brad,” laughed Merry,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_248">248</span> “although it
has tried to be one this afternoon. During the next two
weeks I’m going to show you fellows what real work
is, see? And, when we face Gold Hill you’re going to
win. Regulars and scrubs will be here at two-thirty,
Monday afternoon. To-morrow, Handy,” he added, to
the captain of the club team, “you and I will have a
little talking match at the Ophir House.”</p>

<p>Hope, like the measles, is “catching.” All the players,
even to Spink, Mayburn and Doolittle, began to feel
better.</p>

<p>As Merry walked through the clubhouse, on his way
to the trail that led back to town, he was halted by
Mr. Bradlaugh, the club’s president. Mr. Bradlaugh’s
face was long and gloomy. There was a curious gleam
in his eyes as they fixed themselves upon Merry’s smiling
face.</p>

<p>“Gad,” murmured the president, “you don’t seem worried,
Merriwell.”</p>

<p>“Where were you when the balloon went up, Mr.
Bradlaugh?” Frank inquired.</p>

<p>“On the clubhouse balcony, watching the ascension.
What’s got into the boys?”</p>

<p>“Just an off day with them, I think. That will happen
to the best teams, you know.”</p>

<p>“I was badly disappointed. After three weeks at
Tinaja Wells, the eleven seems to put up a poorer
article of football than they did when they left here to
go into camp. I’m afraid they’ve been having too good
a time, up the cañon.”</p>

<p>“They worked hard and faithfully at the Wells, Mr.
Bradlaugh,” declared Frank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_249">249</span> “The change from the
mesa to their home field may have had a bad effect on
them. Come Monday afternoon and watch them, and I
think you’ll see something worth while. We have two
weeks before the big game, and, by then, the squad will
be tinkered into winning form.”</p>

<p>“Not two weeks, Merriwell.”</p>

<p>Frank started and flung a quick look at Mr. Bradlaugh.</p>

<p>“Has there been a change in the date?” he asked.</p>

<p>“There has. Colonel Hawtrey and I had a talk about
Thanksgiving Day, and made up our minds that it’s
time we followed the practice that prevails in the East.
We’ll not play any more on that particular day, and we
decided that our respective clubs will come together on
Saturday afternoon of next week.”</p>

<p>Frank’s smile faded. The time for whipping the team
into shape had been cut down one-half. Seven days
were left—six days, with Sunday out—and not all of
those six days could be given to hard work. The practice
should slow up for two days before the game.</p>

<p>“Holy smoke!” he muttered. “When did all this
happen?”</p>

<p>“This morning,” Mr. Bradlaugh answered. “I haven’t
had a chance to tell you before. Had I seen the work
of our men previous to my conference with Colonel
Hawtrey, you may be sure that I should have put off the
big game as long as possible. Now it’s too late. A
week from to-day we face Gold Hill. What can you
do in that short time?”</p>

<p>“This is a crack right between the eyes,” murmured
Frank, “and it knocks all my calculations galley west.”</p>

<p>“It’s certainly discouraging,” agreed Mr. Bradlaugh,
“but there’s no help for it. I hear that the Gold Hillers
are playing the game as they never played it before.
They have a new coach who seems to have inaugurated
some new plays and a whole lot of improvements.”</p>

<p>“A new coach?” echoed Frank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_250">250</span> “What’s his name?”</p>

<p>“Guffey. I’ve heard that he’s a phenomenon, not only
as a coach, but as a player.”</p>

<p>Merriwell’s face clouded. Here was more discouraging
news, and he couldn’t help wondering where the
lightning was going to strike next.</p>

<p>Mr. Bradlaugh was quick to note the change in
Frank’s face and manner. He knew the young coach’s
hopes had received a severe setback, and he tried to
temper the blow.</p>

<p>“I don’t know who this Guffey is,” said he, “and I
don’t care. You’re a heap better than he is, and I’ll bank
on it.”</p>

<p>A ghost of a smile flickered about the boy’s lips.</p>

<p>“I’ve been coaching the Ophir team for a long time,
Mr. Bradlaugh,” he remarked, “and you saw the afternoon’s
performance. It wasn’t a credit to me any more
than it was to the eleven.”</p>

<p>“That’s the wrong way to look at it,” was the warm
response. “If you haven’t the material to work with,
what can you do?”</p>

<p>“I’ve got the material,” insisted Frank. “Your son
is a crack half back; Handy, at full, and Spink, at
quarter, are class A, and I haven’t any fault to find
with the rest of the men. There’ll be some shifting,
though, and I may take a couple of players from the
scrubs for the regulars.”</p>

<p>“Suppose this Guffey gets into the Gold Hill line-up?
He’s an amateur, the colonel tells me, and, by our rules,
is qualified to play. Will you jump into the fight if
Guffey does?”</p>

<p>“I’m going to do all I can to make Ophir win,” Frank
answered determinedly.</p>

<p>“You still have hopes, then?”</p>

<p>The young coach had again got himself well in hand.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_251">251</span>
The obstacles were thickening, and, because of them,
final victory over Gold Hill would be a prize worth
while.</p>

<p>“Ophir is going to win!” he declared, and there was
a look on his face and a gleam in his dark eyes that
went far to dispel the president’s gloomy forebodings.</p>

<p>“You’re a brick!” said Mr. Bradlaugh, clapping Frank
on the shoulder. “That’s the spirit, my lad, that leads
many a forlorn hope to victory. We’re going to win—I
consider that settled. If you’re on your way back to
town, jump into my car and I’ll take you. I was only
waiting for a word with you before I started.”</p>

<p>The clubhouse and athletic field were a short mile
out of Ophir. On the way back Merry communed with
himself and took heart out of his very discouragements.</p>

<p>The poor showing of the club team, the short time
in which to make a winner out of it, the good work of
Gold Hill under Guffey—all these things Merry considered
well; and, in the final summing up, they merely
spurred him to fresh endeavors. He was out for Gold
Hill’s scalp, and he was going to get it.</p>

<p>That night, in a most peculiar way, some more disturbing
details were brought home to him. It was about
one in the morning when he heard a pebble rattle against
the window of his room. He got up, lifted the window
cautiously, and looked out into the dark.</p>

<p>“It’s Bleeker,” came a low voice, “Bleeker, of Gold
Hill. Don’t give me away, Merriwell, but come down.
I’ve something I want to tell you.”</p>

<small>GOOD INTENTIONS.</small></h2>


<p>Clancy occupied the room with Merriwell. The latter,
in order to make as little noise as possible, slipped
on his shoes but made no attempt to get out of his
pajamas and into his clothes. Softly opening the hall
door, he stepped out into the dimly lit corridor, descended
the stairs, and got clear of the hotel without
arousing any one.</p>

<p>“This way, Merriwell,” said Bleeker, in a low tone,
appearing suddenly out of the shadows and moving off
toward the rear of the building.</p>

<p>Frank followed him, and they presently halted at a
board fence.</p>

<p>“I reckon we can talk here,” observed Bleeker, “without
any one getting next to what we say.”</p>

<p>“This is quite a surprise party, Bleeker,” said Frank.
“I don’t often have a friend steal in on me like a thief
in the night, just to make a sociable call.”</p>

<p>“You know what people might think, if I came over
to this town in broad day, hunted you up, and had a
talk with you? I’m from Gold Hill, and I used to be on
the Gold Hill eleven until Jode Lenning gave me the
sack. If I happened to be seen here, people would say
I am sore, and that I’m trying to get even with Lenning
by handing you a little information that will help when
Ophir goes up against our crowd next Saturday. That’s
what they’d say, Merriwell, and you know it,” Bleeker
grunted.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_253">253</span> “I’m no traitor, and, while I may feel as
though Jode has played it pretty low down on me, you
can bet I’m not settling scores with him by doing our
eleven any dirt. Understand that, don’t you?”</p>

<p>“Sure,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>“By sneaking over here, like this, and palavering with
you, I’m trying to be white, that’s all. I’d like to do
something to help Ellis Darrel.”</p>

<p>Frank’s interest went up several notches, at that.</p>

<p>“I know you’re a friend of Darrel’s,” said he, “and I
know that you and Hotchkiss got Lenning down on you
while the Gold Hill crowd was in camp a few miles from
Tinaja Wells, at Camp Hawtrey. Are the Gold Hill
fellows still in the gulch?”</p>

<p>“No, Lenning brought them back to town the next
day after your crowd hiked for Ophir. Lenning kicked
Hotch and me out of camp because we stood up for Darrel.
Jode hasn’t any use for a fellow who tries to be
a friend of his half brother’s.”</p>

<p>“Well, Bleek,” said Frank, “Darrel has acted like a
brick all through this trouble of his; and, you take it
from me, that blot on the shield is going to be rubbed out.
One of these days Darrel will be able to take his uncle
by the hand, and the consequences of that forgery are
going to be dropped onto somebody else.”</p>

<p>“Now you are shouting, Merriwell!” exclaimed
Bleeker eagerly. “I never thought Darrel had anything
to do with that, and there are a few more, over in the
Hill, who have been of the same opinion right along.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_254">254</span></p>
<p>“Who do you think did the job and arranged to involve
Darrel?”</p>

<p>“First off, who’d be the gainer if Darrel lost his
uncle’s good will? When you want to figure out a
thing, the proper way is to find the chap with a motive.
Now, you know Colonel Hawtrey is rich, and that the
only relatives he has in the world are his two nephews,
Jode Lenning and Ellis Darrel. Wouldn’t Lenning
come in for all the old colonel’s property if Darrel was
disgraced and run out? Sure he would. The fellow
with the motive was Lenning. And that motive, by
thunder, has been cropping out ever since Darrel came
back.”</p>

<p>This subject was intensely interesting to Merriwell.
He had thrown himself heart and soul into the task of
redeeming the good name of his new chum, Ellis Darrel,
and he believed that now events were forming which
would bring about that result.</p>

<p>“Bleeker,” said Frank earnestly. “I’ve heard that about
the time this forgery was committed you and Jode Lenning
were pretty thick. If that’s so, then you ought to
know something about the forgery.”</p>

<p>Bleeker was silent for a space. Leaning against the
fence, he bent his head and pulled aimlessly at a sliver
on one of the posts.</p>

<p>“You’ve hit it about right, Merriwell,” said he, at last.
“Being friendly with Lenning was no credit to me, but
he had money and I didn’t, and he had influence with
the colonel and stood pretty high in the athletic club—and
the colonel had founded the club. I knuckled under
to Lenning—I reckon you’d call it toadying. If there
were any favors to be passed around, Lenning saw to it
that I got my share. I had a finger in every athletic
pie the club cut open, and several plums came my way.
This wouldn’t have happened, you see, if I hadn’t been
training with Jode. I was wide of the right trail, Merriwell,
but I got to know Jode as few know him. Ever
since our outfit camped in the gulch I’ve done a lot of
thinking about El Darrel and Jode Lenning, and I made
up my mind that Jode and his influence wasn’t worth
a single jab my conscience has been giving me for<span class="pagenum" id="Page_255">255</span>
months. As soon as I woke up, and Jode found it out,
he got mad and made me leave the camp.”</p>

<p>Bleeker had been talking in a shamed sort of way,
with his head bowed. He now looked up, and the moonlight
shone full in his face, bringing out the contrition
that lurked there in strong lights and shadows.</p>

<p>“I’ve sneaked out of Gold Hill,” he went on, “and
into Ophir, as you said a spell ago, ‘like a thief in the
night,’ but I’ve done it because I’m trying to act white
after acting the other way for longer than I care to
think about. I want,” and the words rushed forth in
a torrent of eagerness, “to help El Darrel wipe that blot
from his shield. I can’t do much myself, Merriwell,
but I reckon I can help you.”</p>

<p>A thrill ran through Merriwell. When a fellow has
been traveling the wrong path, and by and by turns of
his own accord into the right one, there is a pleasure in
meeting him halfway and going on together. Frank
grabbed the hand from the post and shook it cordially.</p>

<p>“Bleek,” said he, “you’re all right. You and Hotch
began helping Darrel some time ago, and if we can work
in double harness and show Hawtrey that he had nothing
to do with that forgery, it will be one of the finest things
that ever happened.”</p>

<p>That Bleeker was pleased by Merriwell’s attitude was
plain. His form straightened, his shoulders went back,
and he returned the other’s handclasp with a strong and
determined grip.</p>

<p>“It will,” he said,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_256">256</span> “and I think you can bring it around.
You will be making a star play, Merriwell, and I shall
have the satisfaction of feeling that I helped. Now,
about Jode. I am telling you what everybody knows
when I say that his reckless, hot-headed actions come
to him as a birthright. His father was a desperate
character, in some ways, and was killed in a brawl up in
Alaska. Colonel Hawtrey never had anything to do
with Lenning’s father, and it was only when the elder
Lenning died, and Mrs. Lenning married Darrel, that
the colonel and his sister became reconciled. If you’re
next to this, maybe you won’t blame Jode quite so much
for the way he’s been acting. What a fellow inherits
must have something to do with his conduct.”</p>

<p>“A little, Bleek,” said Frank, “but not a whole lot.
My father has told me that a fellow must build his
own character, and not try to blame his folks when
he goes wrong. But, look here. After the way Lenning
showed himself up to the colonel, at the time Darrel
saved him from the blast, I suppose there’s a coolness
between the two? Certainly Lenning isn’t still on
the Gold Hill eleven?”</p>

<p>“The colonel’s a queer stick,” was the answer.
“There’s been no flare-up between the two, and Jode
is still king bee at the Gold Hill Athletic Club. What
do you make out of that?”</p>

<p>Merriwell was astounded. How was it possible for
the stern old colonel, after having Jode’s “yellow streak”
show itself so clearly under his very eyes, still to keep
on friendly terms with the fellow? Merriwell was not
only amazed, but a bit indignant.</p>

<small>THE MYSTERIOUS BILLY SHOUP.</small></h2>


<p>“That gets my goat, and no mistake!” said Merriwell
disgustedly. “For doing nothing at all, Colonel Hawtrey
drives Darrel out of his house, but when Lenning shows
himself a cur, the colonel hasn’t a thing to say. It makes
me sick!”</p>

<p>“It’s certainly a brain twister, the way Hawtrey acts,”
muttered Bleeker. “All Gold Hill is sitting up nights,
trying to figure it out. Somehow, you know, it doesn’t
seem like the old colonel at all. He’s sharp and savage
when anything ruffles him, and people just about expected
he’d flay Lenning and nail his hide to the front
door. All he did, though, was to pat Lenning on the
shoulder and congratulate him on the way he got clear
of the coyote dog.”</p>

<p>Merriwell acted as though he was stunned. His feelings,
at that moment, were too deep for words.</p>

<p>“Lenning,” Bleeker went on, “had already asked the
colonel to send for this chap Guffey to coach the eleven.
Lenning, as captain of the Gold Hill eleven, was scared
by the way the Ophir boys held his squad in that practice
game you had at Tinaja Wells. He wanted a bang-up
coach, and asked the colonel for Guffey. Nobody had
ever heard of Guffey—that is, nobody except Lenning—and
the colonel sort of held off about getting him. It
wasn’t until after Jode showed his yellow streak that
the colonel had Guffey come on. They say he’s a whirlwind.”</p>

<p>“How old is he?” Merry inquired, his interest taking a
new tack.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_258">258</span></p>

<p>“Twenty, maybe—not over that.”</p>

<p>“Where did he come from?”</p>

<p>“No sabe.”</p>

<p>“What does he look like?”</p>

<p>“Hair black as ink, eyes a washed-out blue——”</p>

<p>“Queer combination!”</p>

<p>“And you’d swear, to give him a keen sizing, that he
was an athlete and had gone wrong with some kind of
dope. His skin’s a dead white, and there are puffs under
his eyes. He soft foots it around like a wild cat, and
acts so nervous you think he’s getting ready to spring.
But he can deliver the goods. They say he has done
wonders with the Gold Hill eleven.”</p>

<p>“If he’s a professional athlete——”</p>

<p>“He’s not. Everybody has the colonel’s word for that.
But Guffey, you take it from me, is as crooked as a
dog’s hind foot.”</p>

<p>“If he’s a dope fiend,” said Frank, “he’s pretty apt to
be crooked. Fellows of that sort may be brilliant, at
times, but it’s only a flash while they’re in the power
of the drug. Take the drug away from them and they’re
human jellyfish. None of them last long.”</p>

<p>“That may be, but your crowd will have to go some if
you make a clean-up next Saturday.”</p>

<p>Merry received this remark in thoughtful silence. He
was wondering about this Guffey person, and where and
how he had made himself such a phenomenal coach.</p>

<p>“Well, Bleek,” said he presently, “let’s drop Guffey
and get back to Curly Darrel. I want to do what I can
to help him, and you haven’t dipped very deep into anything
as yet.”</p>

<p>“I’m coming to that right now.” Bleeker straightened
and peered cautiously around into the wavering shadows.
“We’re all by ourselves here, aren’t we?” he asked.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_259">259</span></p>

<p>“The only people who are anywhere near us are in the
hotel, and they’re all asleep,” said Frank reassuringly.</p>

<p>“What I tell you is in strict confidence.”</p>

<p>“Sure. You can trust me, can’t you? Fire away.”</p>

<p>“Has Darrel ever told you how he happened to get
mixed up in that forgery affair?”</p>

<p>“He has said mighty little about it. I don’t think he
knows very much himself. He told me that he made
a wrong move—a move he always regretted. Lenning
was drinking and gambling on the q.  t., and managing
to keep it away from the colonel, so Darrel side-stepped
and went into it himself. One night he gambled and
grew sort of hazy; couldn’t remember what happened;
and when he had his wits, next day, the forged check
for five hundred showed up, and the fellow who had
it said Darrel had given it to him to square a gambling
debt. But Darrel couldn’t remember a thing about it.”</p>

<p>“I was one of a party of four when that happened,”
said Bleeker huskily, and fairly driving the words out.</p>

<p>“You were?” Frank returned excitedly.</p>

<p>“It hurts like the devil to say it, but I believe it’s
a duty. Yes, I was there. Besides myself, there were
Darrel, a fellow who lives in Gold Hill, and the mysterious
Billy Shoup.”</p>

<p>“Lenning wasn’t around?”</p>

<p>“No. We had had one or two drinks—first and only
time I ever touched the stuff, and I’ve registered a
solemn vow that it will be the last—and I noticed that
El was acting queerly. There was a far-away look in
his eyes, and when you spoke to him it seemed like he
had to come back from a thousand miles away before
he could answer you. Shoup poured the stuff we drank,
and I’ve thought since that he dropped something into
El’s glass. I can’t be sure of that, but I know he had<span class="pagenum" id="Page_260">260</span>
his hand over the glass before he set it down. The other
chap and I got out of money, and when we left Darrel
and Shoup were still at it. I tried to get El to go home,
and nearly had a fight with Shoup because I did. El
just sat in his chair and stared at me, never making a
move to leave. Next day Shoup offered the forged
check to the colonel. The colonel took five hundred
from his safe, gave it to Shoup, and then very neatly
kicked him down the front steps.”</p>

<p>“This has all the earmarks of a plot, and no mistake,”
muttered Merry.</p>

<p>“It has,” agreed Bleeker. “I’ve been a year turning it
over in my mind and coming to that conclusion.”</p>

<p>“Didn’t you go to Hawtrey and tell him about what
happened?”</p>

<p>“No. Don’t blame me for that, Merriwell. I thought,
at the time, that perhaps Darrel might have put the
colonel’s name to the check. And then, consider my
own situation. I didn’t want it known that I had been
guzzling poison with a fellow like Shoup.”</p>

<p>“Shoup! You called him a moment ago ‘the mysterious
Billy Shoup.’ Why did you do that?”</p>

<p>“Because he was a stranger in Gold Hill. No one
knew where he came from, nor where he went. I saw
him just twice—the night we gambled and the next afternoon.
He and Lenning were in the cañon, palavering.
They didn’t see me, and I didn’t care to see Shoup, so I
hustled away. I told Lenning about it afterward, and
he said he’d kill me if I ever mentioned having seen him
with Shoup. He explained that he thought Shoup had
done some crooked work, and he had been trying to
pump him and do something for Darrel.”</p>

<p>“Fine!” exclaimed Merry scornfully.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_261">261</span> “A fat lot Lenning
was doing for his half brother.”</p>

<p>“That night,” proceeded Bleeker, “Billy Shoup faded
out of Gold Hill, and no one in town has heard anything
about him since. That’s why I called him the
mysterious Billy Shoup.”</p>

<p>“Regular gambler, wasn’t he?”</p>

<p>“He didn’t look it. Rather youngish, he was—nineteen
or twenty—and he had a mop of hair about the
color of tow. That’s all, Merriwell,” and Bleeker drew
a long breath. “I’ve got it off my chest, at last. Jumping
sandhills, what a fix a little gambling and drinking
will get a fellow into! I had my lesson, and I’ll bet El
had his. If Darrel hadn’t been a bit wild, he’d never
have got mixed up in that forgery trouble.”</p>

<p>“And the night you were with Shoup, Jode Lenning
was—where?”</p>

<p>“At home with the colonel, reading to him in his
study. He was doing the dutiful, you see, and going to
bed early.”</p>

<p>“Doing the dutiful for a purpose,” commented Merriwell
scathingly.</p>

<p>“That’s what I think. He got Shoup to come on and
throw the hooks into El—that’s the way I size it up.”</p>

<p>“How can it be proved?”</p>

<p>“Search me. That’s where your star play comes in,
Merriwell. It’s up to you to find Billy Shoup and make
him talk. I’ve given you all the facts I have, and you’re
welcome to go ahead and use them.”</p>

<p>“It’s a pretty big proposition, Bleek,” said Merriwell
disappointedly. “This confounded Shoup is so mysterious
that we haven’t the first thing in the way of a clew.
Perhaps the whole affair could be got out of Lenning?”</p>

<p>“You don’t know Lenning! He’s a fox.”</p>

<p>Merriwell leaned over the fence and looked up at the
moon and stars, riding in all the calm serenity of an<span class="pagenum" id="Page_262">262</span>
Arizona night. Bleeker had offered him something to
work on in helping Darrel, but it was something which
broke in his hands like a rope of sand. Where was
Billy Shoup? A year had passed since his mysterious
visit to Gold Hill, and a great many things may happen
in a year to a fellow of Shoup’s probable stamp. Was
the fellow still alive? If so, would he be East or West?
He had a wide country for his roaming, and hunting
for a needle in a haystack was easy work compared
with the task of locating him. If found, would it be
possible to make him talk? Hardly. If he admitted
forging the check himself, he merely cleared his own
path to the penitentiary. If he confessed that Lenning
had furnished the check, then it was a matter of his
unsupported word against that of the favorite nephew.
There was no doubt as to which of the pair the colonel
would believe.</p>

<p>“I’ve put it up to you, Merriwell,” said Bleeker, at
last, “and now I reckon I’ll point for Gold Hill. I have
a horse, out in the brush, and the animal is probably
getting tired waiting for me.”</p>

<p>“You’ve shed a little light, Bleeker,” said Frank,
dropping his troubled eyes from the sky and resting
them on the face of the lad from Gold Hill, “but I’ll be
darned if I know what I can do. Isn’t there any way
we can pick up a clew as to the whereabouts of Shoup?”</p>

<p>“Not that I know of. Lenning could probably give
a clew, but he wouldn’t. He knows what it would mean
to him.”</p>

<p>“Any objection to my repeating what you have said to
Darrel? He’ll be in Ophir some time during the week—Dolliver’s
ranch can’t hold him very long.”</p>

<p>“He knows most of what I’ve told you,” answered
Bleeker,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_263">263</span> “but you can tell him as much as you please.
If I hear of anything that will help, I’ll get the information
to you, somehow. I’ve a hunch that Darrel’s going
to come out of this all right. But I reckon you don’t
believe in hunches, eh? Well, anyhow, I’ve done what
I could. So long, Merriwell, and good luck.”</p>

<p>The Gold Hill lad who had tried to be “white” shook
Merry’s hand and moved swiftly and noiselessly off
into the gloom. Merry stood and watched him until
he had disappeared, then slowly and carefully made his
way back into the hotel.</p>

<p>“I’d give a hundred dollars,” he said to himself, “if
I knew where to find this mysterious Billy Shoup.”</p>

<small>THE MAN THE BOX.</small></h2>


<p>“Where’s the water?”</p>

<p>Merriwell stirred and opened his eyes. He was usually
an early riser, but an hour or two had been chopped
out of his sleeping schedule during the night by Bleeker.
For this reason he wasn’t so prompt in beating Clancy
out of bed that morning, as was generally the case.</p>

<p>Clancy had just husked himself out of his pajamas
and was standing wrathfully over a washtub—an empty
washtub.</p>

<p>“Who’s trying to hold the morning dip out on me?”
demanded Clancy, throwing a look of suspicion at Merry.</p>

<p>“How do I know?” asked Merry. “Don’t be so
darned ambitious on a Sunday morning. Bottle up and
let a fellow sleep.”</p>

<p>With that he knocked the red-headed chap off his
balance with a pillow. There was a great racket as
Clancy sat down hard in the empty tub.</p>

<p>“No one can do that to me and live,” hissed Clancy,
wriggling out of the tub and rushing at his chum.</p>

<p>It was the duty of Woo Sing, Chinese roustabout in
the hotel, to fill the tub with cold water. The first lad
out of bed took his plunge, and the second one up had to
empty and fill the tub for himself. Now Woo Sing, who
was allowed an honorarium for his work, had failed in
his duty.</p>

<p>While Merry and Clancy were laughing and pounding
each other with pillows, a screech from the back yard
claimed their attention. The screech was followed by<span class="pagenum" id="Page_265">265</span>
a wild assortment of words in three separate and distinct
voices.</p>

<p>“China boy fillee tub, by Klismas!”</p>

<p>“Py shinks, I fill dot tub myselluf, und dot’s all
aboudt it.”</p>

<p>“Me, I fill de tub.”</p>

<p>Merry and Clancy stepped away from each other,
listened, and then moved toward a window. A look
into the back yard at once disclosed the reason why the
bath water had not been provided.</p>

<p>The Chinaman evidently had started for the second
floor of the hotel with a filled pail, but before he could
get into the building he had been waylaid by Fritz Gesundheit
and the Mexican, Silva. The Dutchman and
the Mexican had each laid hold of the pail, and all three
were glaring at each other over the top of it.</p>

<p>Fritz, otherwise Carrots, was out of a job now that
the Ophir fellows had come in from Tinaja Wells, and
the same was equally true of Silva. Carrying water for
the bath had looked like easy money to the Dutchman
and the Mexican, and each of them had made up his
mind to kick Chinese labor off the job and monopolize
the work and the honorarium. Woo Sing, however, was
registering objections.</p>

<p>“Lettee go pail!” cried the Chinaman. “No lettee go,
my bleakee head! By jim klickets, Melican sons guns
no makee fool business allee same China boy!”</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Caramba!</i>” breathed Silva darkly. “De water ees
mine for carry. I make insist. Hands off de pail,
<i lang ="es-mx">muy pronto</i>!”</p>

<p>“By Shiminy,” wheezed fat Fritz, “I vas gedding my
mad oop like I can’t tell! I take der pail myselluf.”</p>

<p>Then began a savage tussle with the pail of water as<span class="pagenum" id="Page_266">266</span>
the bone of contention. It proved a mighty unsatisfactory
bone to fight over, for as it heaved and jumped
under the straining hands and arms, a quart went into
the Dutchman’s face and a cupful found its way down
the Mexican’s back. This caused little damage, apart
from putting a keener edge on the tempers of Fritz
and Silva. Ceasing the struggle for the pail, they began
giving their attention to each other.</p>

<p>There was a close and animated tangle of heads, arms,
and legs—the pail somewhere in the midst. As the
massed combatants surged back and forth, they left a
trail of water; and their cries, which were wild and
continuous, were all awash and filled with strangles and
bad words—words on which they choked.</p>

<p>Merriwell and Clancy, at the second-story window,
were enjoying the spectacle hugely. It seemed to be
reaching a serious phase, however, and they were just
thinking of putting a stop to it when the Chinaman’s
heels went into the air and the Dutchman and the Mexican
fell away from him.</p>

<p>Woo Sing, by some weird mischance, had taken a
header. The pail happened to be placed so as to receive
him. For half a minute he was emerged to the shoulders
in the pail, his sandaled heels kicking the air. It
was a mirthful exhibition, and Fritz and Silva enjoyed it.</p>

<p>“Haw, haw, haw!” the Dutchman wheezed. “Vat a
funny Chinaman I don’d know! See, vonce, how he
kicks his heels mit der air, und keeps his headt der
pail in! Iss der vater py der pail? Yah, so hellup me!
Vill der Chinaman be trowned? Dere iss not so mooch
goot luck!”</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Madre mia!</i>” tittered the Mexican, holding up against
the pump while he gasped and chuckled and roared.
“Dat ees no Chinaman, dat ees one frog! De frog he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_267">267</span>
take one dive in de pail, and he make t’ink de pail
ees a pond—har, har, har!”</p>

<p>Woo Sing, about as mad a Chinaman as one could find,
succeeded at last in getting his feet on the ground. Half
strangled, he lifted himself erect. Now that he was
right side up, of course the pail was upside down. A
flood of water was released and rolled over the Chinaman
like a tidal wave. His kimono and baggy breeches
were soaked. With a sputtering whoop, he tore the pail
from his head and hurled it at Fritz.</p>

<p>The pail caught the Dutchman in the pit of the
stomach, doubling him up with something besides laughter.
Having attended to Fritz, the water-soaked Celestial
rushed at Silva.</p>

<p>The Mexican, in jumping away from the pump, hit the
handle with his knee. It flew up and struck him a terrific
blow under the chin. While Silva was thus more
or less demoralized, the Chinaman fell on him and bore
him down.</p>

<p>Fritz, who had by a valiant effort succeeded in getting
his breath back, was “seeing red.” Reckless of consequences,
he picked up a club and started to even up
matters with Woo Sing. The mêlée was becoming too
serious to be tolerated any further. Up to that point
Merry and Clancy had enjoyed the performance in the
back yard immensely.</p>

<p>Clancy leaned out of the window to shout a yell of
warning. Merry, however, pulled him back, a mirthful
glimmer in his dark eyes.</p>

<p>“I’ll stop it, Clan,” he whispered. “Watch.”</p>

<p>Merriwell was past master in the art of “throwing his
voice.” Ventriloquism had afforded him a good deal
of fun, and had occasionally been of decided benefit to
him and his affairs.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_268">268</span></p>

<p>Near the kitchen woodpile was a large box. It was
empty and Pophagan, proprietor of the hotel, had thrown
it into the backyard to be broken to pieces and used for
kindling. The box was still intact, however.</p>

<p>“Stop that!” boomed a deep voice, apparently coming
from inside the box. “No more of that rough-house or
I’ll put you all in jail. D’you hear?”</p>

<p>The voice was heard, plainly enough. The effect was
startling.</p>

<p>“<i lang ="de">Ach, du lieber!</i>” sputtered Fritz, all his anger fading
from him in a flash. “Who iss dot? Iss it some boliceman?”</p>

<p>“Plaps him p’leeceman,” whimpered Woo Sing, dashing
the water out of his eyes with the back of his hand.
“My no likee go to jail! Whoosh!”</p>

<p>“Dat ees muy malo!” chattered Silva, holding his chin
and showing the whites of his eyes. “How you s’pose
man get in de box, huh?”</p>

<p>“Dot iss a plame’ funny blace for a man, py shinks!”
commented the wondering Fritz.</p>

<p>“Get me out of here quick,” came the voice from
the box, “or I’ll nab the lot of you!”</p>

<p>“<i lang ="es-mx">Caramba!</i>” gulped the Mexican. “Me, I no like to
fool wit’ de box.”</p>

<p>“Mebbyso Melican man gettee stuck in box,” suggested
Woo Sing. “Him wantee out. My no likee
one piecee pidgin, too. We helpee him, huh?”</p>

<p>The object for which Merriwell had been striving had
been accomplished. Peace reigned among the three in the
back yard. It was a sloppy sort of peace, for all of
them were more or less drenched, but still it was peace
for all that.</p>

<p>A community of interest had drawn the three together.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_269">269</span>
Just now, to their disordered fancies, the possibility of
a term in jail loomed very large.</p>

<p>“I t’ink ve pedder hellup der feller oudt oof der pox,”
said Fritz, after a period of harrowing reflection. “Silfa,
you go fairst and I vill precede mit der chink.”</p>

<p>“You yourself go first to de box!” implored Woo
Sing.</p>

<p>“Please, fat Melican man!” implored Woo Sing.</p>

<p>“Help, help!” came the voice, in a roar. “I’m listening
to what you fellows say out there. When I get
out, you can bet I’ll take care of the ones who don’t
come to my rescue.”</p>

<p>As soon as this statement had had time to sink in, all
three of those who were standing at a distance from the
box rushed as one man to get near it and to release the
supposed person inside.</p>

<p>Clancy was red in the face with suppressed mirth.
Merry, leaning against the window casing, was enjoying
the situation to the utmost.</p>

<p>“Now for some fun,” murmured Clancy, “when they
turn the box over and find there’s no one inside.”</p>

<p>“This is pretty rich, and no mistake,” chuckled Merry.
“They’re all going to lay hold of the box and lift it.
They——”</p>

<p>The words died on his lips. Just then something happened
which caused a chilly feeling to race along his
spine, and Clancy’s rapture vanished on the instant.</p>

<p>Before a hand could be laid on the box, it began to
lift—apparently of its own accord. Fritz, Silva, and
Woo Sing stepped back. They, of course, were in no
wise startled for they were expecting to find some one
under the big packing case. But Merry and Clancy
could only gasp and stare downward with wide eyes.</p>

<p>The box, by a force exerted from within, was tilted<span class="pagenum" id="Page_270">270</span>
backward. A young fellow showed himself, unkempt
and his clothes in disorder from several hours in such
cramped quarters.</p>

<p>He was not a tramp, that was evident. His clothing
was of excellent quality and fitted him well. Surprise
followed surprise for Merry, for he presently noticed
that the youth’s hair was as black as a raven’s wing,
his eyes a faded blue, and his skin a waxlike and
unhealthy white!</p>

<p>Merriwell, astounded beyond words, leaned against the
side of the window and continued to peer blankly outward
and downward at the odd group in the rear of the
hotel.</p>

<p>The man who had been under the box had his coat
over his arm and his sleeves rolled to the elbow. With
a snarling, angry cry he leaped past the Mexican, the
Dutchman and the Chinaman, and sprinted at a tremendous
clip to get out of the way.</p>

<p>“Catch that fellow!” cried Merriwell, finally waking
up. “Come on, Clan!”</p>

<p>The red-headed chap came out of his daze in time
to plunge for a dressing gown and a pair of slippers, and
then to dart into the hall and away after his chum.</p>

<small>GUFFEY’S QUEER ACTIONS.</small></h2>


<p>Merriwell was in his pajamas, and as it was getting a
time of day when people began to stir around, the scope
of his efforts in overhauling the fellow who had been
under the box was naturally limited. He had hoped that
Fritz, Silva and Woo Sing might take up the pursuit, but
in this he was disappointed.</p>

<p>“Where is the fellow?” Merry demanded, showing
himself at a rear door and confronting the Dutchman,
the Chinaman, and the Mexican.</p>

<p>“He vent avay like some shtreaks,” Fritz answered.</p>

<p>“Why didn’t you try to stop him?”</p>

<p>“He iss a boliceman, dot’s der reason.”</p>

<p>“Nonsense!” exclaimed Merry, “he’s no more a policeman
than you are.”</p>

<p>“Ven he iss under der pox he say——”</p>

<p>“I know what he said, Carrots. Look here! What
do you, and Silva, and Woo Sing mean by making such
a disturbance on Sunday morning?”</p>

<p>“Dot vas a mishap, Merrivell, und nodding more.”</p>

<p>“Well, don’t let it happen again. Sing, bring up the
water. What’s that you just picked up, Silva?”</p>

<p>The Mexican, standing near the uptilted box, had bent
down and picked up some object off the ground.</p>

<p>“No sabe, señor,” said he, coming toward Merry and
handing over his “find.”</p>

<p>Frank examined it carefully and discovered that it
was a small, needle-pointed syringe, a “hypoderm,” such
as is used by drug fiends to puncture the arm and inject
their slow-working poison into the veins.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_272">272</span></p>

<p>“The fellow under the box must have dropped that,”
remarked Clancy.</p>

<p>“It’s a cinch that he did,” answered Merry.</p>

<p>“Now I know what that pasty face of his means. He’s
a slave of the needle, Chip.”</p>

<p>“Yes,” nodded Frank. “Let’s go back upstairs, Clan,”
he added, starting through the hotel and toward the
stairs.</p>

<p>In the hallway on the second floor they met Ballard.
He was fully dressed and was hurrying down to find out
what was going on.</p>

<p>“I saw that squabble in the back yard,” he remarked,
“and I thought Chip was back of that voice under the
box. When the black-haired chap showed himself, it
almost took me off my feet.”</p>

<p>“Same here,” chuckled Clancy. “Chip did throw his
voice so that it seemed to come from the box.”</p>

<p>“Then he knew there was some one there?”</p>

<p>“Not so you could notice it, Pink,” Merry returned,
with a puzzled laugh. “I hadn’t an idea there was a
fellow under the box when I threw my voice in that
direction and tried to stop the row. You could have
knocked me down with a feather when that box began to
lift.”</p>

<p>“Funny stunt,” put in Clancy, “and don’t you forget it.
What do you suppose the fellow was doing there?”</p>

<p>“You’re liable to find a dope fiend almost any place.
They’re half crazy all the time. But I happen to know
who this particular fellow is.”</p>

<p>“You do?” cried Clancy and Ballard, together. “Who
is he?”</p>

<p>“Come in and shut the door,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>After the tub had been twice filled by Woo Sing and
Merry and Clancy had had their plunge, while they were<span class="pagenum" id="Page_273">273</span>
dressing Merry told his chums about the new coach that
had been doing such wonders with the Gold Hill football
team. In his talk he did not mention Bleeker in
any way, but referred principally to his conversation
with Mr. Bradlaugh the preceding afternoon.</p>

<p>“This Guffey,” Frank proceeded, “seems to be a
stranger to nearly every one but Jode Lenning. Jode,
it seems, got scared at the brand of football we put up
during the game at Tinaja Wells, and he begged the
colonel to send for Guffey. After that incident in the
gulch, when the blast came so near going off and killing
Hawtrey, Guffey was sent for. They say he has done
marvels with that Gold Hill squad.”</p>

<p>“Let me get this business straight in my mind, Chip,”
said Ballard. “You’ve opened up a few leads that I
can’t understand. Is Jode Lenning still hand-and-glove
with the colonel?”</p>

<p>“Seems to be.”</p>

<p>Clancy and Ballard turned startled, uncomprehending
looks at Merry.</p>

<p>“Thunder!” exclaimed the red-headed chap. “I can’t
understand that, at all.”</p>

<p>“Nor I, Clan,” said Frank. “The colonel’s a queer
one, and that’s the least you can say. Jode wanted Guffey.
Guffey proves to be a dope fiend, but a brilliant
coach. He’s a young fellow, too, and a horrible example
for any other young fellow who feels like tagging him
over such a course. From what I know of Colonel
Hawtrey I can’t begin to understand why he will have
anything to do with such a man as Guffey. Hawtrey is
a stickler for clean living and sportsmanlike conduct,
and this Guffey isn’t the sort to appeal to him a little
bit.”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_274">274</span></p>
<p>“The clouds continue to gather on Ophir’s football
horizon,” observed Ballard, with an effort. “If that
game is lost next Saturday——” He finished with a
look that expressed his meaning better than words.</p>

<p>“We’re not going to lose it,” declared Merry.</p>

<p>“That’s the spirit, old man!” approved Clancy. “Still,”
he added doubtfully, “you’ve got a man’s job on your
hands if you succeed in pounding the club team into
winning form. Since we came in from Tinaja Wells
the eleven appears to have gone all to pieces.”</p>

<p>“They’re not reliable, those fellows,” growled Ballard.
“Remember how they made a farce of their practice
work along at the first when they were out to show
Chip what they could do?”</p>

<p>It wasn’t likely the three lads would ever forget that.
The team had made a poor showing at the start; and
now, after weeks of careful coaching, the showing was
but little better.</p>

<p>After all, Merriwell was asking himself, did the fault
really lie in the material? He could not bring himself
to think this. The Saturday’s game had merely been
called on an “off” day for the regulars. He had faith
to believe that the game Monday afternoon would turn
out differently.</p>

<p>“We’re getting away from the point I’m trying to
get at,” said Merriwell suddenly. “What I’d like to
know is, why is Guffey in Ophir? What business has
he here when his work is all in Gold Hill?”</p>

<p>“Think he was spying upon this hotel?” queried Ballard.</p>

<p>Merriwell started. Instinctively his thoughts recurred
to Bleeker and the conference he and Bleeker had had
the night before.</p>

<p>Was Guffey under the box at the time? Had he trailed<span class="pagenum" id="Page_275">275</span>
Bleeker to the hotel and then hidden himself away so
as to listen to what passed between Bleeker and Merry?</p>

<p>A moment’s reflections all but convinced Frank that
this could not have been the case. If Guffey had sneaked
to the hotel on Bleeker’s trail, then when Bleeker left
Guffey would also have gone away. There was no possible
explanation of the Gold Hill coach’s presence under
the box except the one that had to do with his hypoderm
and his morphine. Feeling the need of the drug, Guffey
had crawled off into the most convenient quarters he
could find; from that moment until the antics of Fritz,
Silva, and Woo Sing had aroused him he had been in the
grip of the drug demons.</p>

<p>This, at least, seemed to Merriwell the most plausible
explanation. As evidence that his theory was correct,
he had that little “hypoderm” which had been found near
the box by Silva.</p>

<p>“No, Pink,” said Merry, “I don’t think Guffey was
spying upon this hotel. What good would a move of
that sort do him? If he wanted to find out anything
regarding our club eleven he’d be hiding somewhere near
the grid.” A grim smile crossed Merry’s face. “Guffey
would have enjoyed the performance if he had been out
there yesterday afternoon.”</p>

<p>“He’d have carried a lot of good cheer back to Gold
Hill,” grinned Ballard. “Oh, well, hang them and their
dopey coach. I guess Ophir will wiggle out of the set-to
in pretty fair shape.”</p>

<p>“What did you want to capture Guffey for, Chip?”
queried Clancy. “What was the idea?”</p>

<p>“I suggested that on the spur of the moment,” Frank
answered.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_276">276</span> “It was like a blow in the face when I
recognized the fellow, from the description I had had
of him. What I wanted was to learn what he was
here for. Now I’ve pretty well decided that he wasn’t
in his right mind when he crawled into the box. He
was crazy for some of that drug. Strikes me, fellows,
that’s about all there is to his being there.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment the breakfast gong sounded.</p>

<p>“There goes the chuck signal,” chirped Ballard. “Come
on, you two.”</p>

<p>They piled downstairs, hung their hats on the rack
by the dining-room door, and went in to their accustomed
seats at the table. Here a fresh surprise awaited them.</p>

<p>The fellow who had been on the subject of their recent
debate upstairs was in the dining room calmly eating his
breakfast. He did not sit at the same table where Frank
and his chums had their places, but at another farther
toward the center of the room.</p>

<p>All three of the boys stopped, hands on the backs
of their chairs. Clancy nudged Merriwell with his elbow.</p>

<p>Guffey’s appearance had undergone a very decided
change for the better. His clothes had been smoothed
out and brushed, his black hair neatly combed, and he
looked quite as respectable as any coach ought to look.
He was completely master of himself, too, and he met
the gaze of the three chums leveled at him with perfect
self-control. He smiled pleasantly, got up from
his chair, and stepped toward Merriwell.</p>

<p>“Frank Merriwell, isn’t it?” he asked, in a voice
low and well modulated. “I thought so,” he went on,
as Frank nodded. “My name is Guffey, and I’m the
new coach over at Gold Hill. We are coaching rival
teams, Merriwell, but we’re true sportsmen, eh? We
can be on friendly terms for all that?”</p>

<p>“Of course,” Frank answered, a little dazedly.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_277">277</span> “Glad
to meet you, Guffey. My friends, Owen Clancy and
Billy Ballard.”</p>

<p>Guffey transferred his right to Clancy and Ballard,
smiled again, murmured his acknowledgments, and then
returned to his waiting chair. It was all very nicely
done, and it was plain that Guffey, the coach, knew how
to be a gentleman.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be darned!” muttered Clancy. “Say, Chip,
is that really the dope fiend we saw coming out from
under the box?”</p>

<p>“No doubt of it,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>“He acts and looks like a different fellow—still, that
pasty face, that black hair, and those washed-out blue
eyes are the same. Why is he here? Is it a case of
nerve on his part?”</p>

<p>“You’ll have to ask me something easier than that,”
Merry answered, dismissing Guffey from his mind and
giving his whole attention to his meal.</p>

<small>REVIVING HOPES.</small></h2>


<p>Guffey left the dining room before Frank and his
chums had finished their breakfast. When they finally
came out they found Handy, captain of the Ophir eleven,
waiting for them. Handy showed traces of excitement.</p>

<p>“What was Guffey, the Gold Hill coach, doing over
here, Chip?” he demanded.</p>

<p>“Nothing more than eating his breakfast, Handy, so
far as I know. Are you acquainted with him?”</p>

<p>“I’ve heard him described, and I thought I had him
spotted as he passed through the office. To settle any
doubts, I looked at the register. There was his name,
plain enough: ‘Simeon Guffey, Gold Hill.’ I don’t like
the idea of his sneaking around Ophir like this.”</p>

<p>“Don’t be in a taking about it, old man,” said Frank
soothingly. “Where did he go?”</p>

<p>“There was a horse out in front, and he got into
the saddle and pointed for the cañon trail. On his way
back to Gold Hill, I reckon.”</p>

<p>“Come on up to my room,” said Merry. “Clan, you
and Pink had better come, too.”</p>

<p>When they had the captain behind the closed door,
Frank told him about the squabble in the back yard,
and how, in a most surprising way, Guffey had been
discovered under the empty packing case. Frank propounded
his theory as to why Guffey was in that peculiar
place, and produced the “hypoderm” in evidence.</p>

<p>Handy was experiencing an attack of nerves and
was ready to see the hidden hand of the Gold Hill club
in anything and everything that looked a little off color.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_279">279</span></p>

<p>“There’s something back of his being here,” he declared,
“and it’s a heap more than you imagine, Merriwell.
Guffey didn’t blow into town for any good. He
may use the dope, but you can gamble that he’s not using
it to an extent that queers him in his work as coach.”</p>

<p>It was several minutes before Frank and his chums
could calm Handy sufficiently for a talk about football.
At last, however, they began a study of the club eleven
with the view of shifting the players around and getting
better results.</p>

<p>“I wouldn’t drop any of the boys from the regular
team, Chip,” said the captain earnestly.</p>

<p>“It would be a bad move at this late day,” Frank answered,
“to put in some new men from the scrub team.
If we had two weeks left I don’t know but I’d try it,
but with only four days for good, hard practice, dropping
anybody from the eleven would be a mistake. Win
or lose, Handy, we’ll use the material we have. We
can do a little shifting, though.”</p>

<p>“I made a monkey of myself yesterday,” declared
Handy, with a firm determination to shoulder all the
consequences of his own mistakes, “and that’s what
played the dickens with the quarter. But I was nervous,
and the way the scrubs lit into us had me rattled. I’ve
a notion all the boys felt the same way. We went into
that game overconfident and careless; then, when we
began getting the worst of it, we slopped over in the
other direction and took our backsets too much to heart.
We’ll do better to-morrow.”</p>

<p>“You’ve got to, that’s all,” said Merriwell grimly.
“What will happen if Gold Hill gets the best of it in
next Saturday’s game?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_280">280</span></p>
<p>“It would make the third time, hand-running, that
we’ve gone down to defeat at the hands of that other
crowd. If that happens, everybody in Ophir will be disgusted,
and this athletic club of ours will go to the
dogs.”</p>

<p>“Is it as bad as that?”</p>

<p>“It’s worse!” declared Handy. “If you had lived in
this town for a year or two, you’d know more about
the feeling that prevails regarding these football games.”</p>

<p>“Then, if that’s the way you hook up, we’ve got to
win.”</p>

<p>“We have, if it takes a leg.”</p>

<p>After two hours of thoughtful discussion, during which
each individual player on the regular team was thoroughly
studied, two or three shifts made in the line-up,
and a little talk indulged in that renewed the captain’s
ardor and determination, the meeting broke up.</p>

<p>For most of the regulars and second-string men, however,
it was a blue Monday when they assembled in the
gym for the afternoon’s work. Their faces were long
and gloomy as they squatted around on the floor in their
football togs and listened to a little sharp grilling from
the captain.</p>

<p>Merriwell followed Handy. The faults and mistakes
of the preceding Saturday afternoon he flashed before
the player’s eyes in detail. There was terror in the
souls of the regular eleven; but fears were relieved somewhat
when not one of the team was publicly disgraced
by being dropped to the scrub. At last, tingling in every
nerve, the men were sent to the field for another contest
with the second eleven.</p>

<p>And, this time, the regulars did their work admirably.
The practice was secret, and no evil, greedy eyes were
staring out from between the benches of the grand stand.
The club eleven lit into the scrubs with a savage fury
that swept all before them. Never once, in all the fierce<span class="pagenum" id="Page_281">281</span>
battling of the game, was the regular’s goal in danger.
This was a romp to victory, but with none of the gala
features of a romp about it. Intensity of purpose
marked every play. And the final score was so many
to nothing that the dusty, sweating, worn-out scrubs were
awed and chastened.</p>

<p>Tuesday afternoon the work was even harder. The
scrub team was strengthened by the addition of Ballard
and Clancy, and while it was being hurriedly organized,
farther down the oval of the field, the regulars were
being run through the signals. Up and down the field
they rushed in rehearsal of all the complicated attacks.
The numbers, flung out by Merry, cracked like a blacksnake
whip; and, with every crack, the players leaped
to their work. Again and again the coach charged the
team, now against one goal and now against the other.</p>

<p>After a brief rest the strengthened scrub teams appears.
Against them the regulars are pitted for a whirlwind
fight of half an hour, cut in two by an interval
of two minutes.</p>

<p>The hardiest of the players flop over on the warm
sand, utterly exhausted, when the whistle stops the playing.
Merriwell is boring down into their endurance as
no coach has ever done before. But they do not complain.
They know he is doing it for the glory of Ophir.</p>

<p>That Tuesday-afternoon match was rendered brilliant
by the playing of Owen Clancy at quarter. He and
Ballard, encouraging the second eleven, gave the regulars
a grapple that they will long remember.</p>

<p>Wednesday is a repetition of Tuesday, only worse in
its grinding, gruelling labor, if that were possible. Like
tigers, with sinews of steel and a suddenness of lightning,
the regulars spring at the throats of the scrubs.
Every man on the second eleven is putting up the fight<span class="pagenum" id="Page_282">282</span>
of his life. He knows that the harder he can make it
for the regulars, the more it will be for the glory of
Ophir. Brilliantly supported by Clancy and Ballard and,
along toward the end, by Merry at half, they bring out
the very last ounce of power and ability which the club
team has in store.</p>

<p>The regulars have possession of the ball. They smash
into the scrubs like a living catapult, hunting from end
to end of the scrub line for the one weak point. After
thirty minutes of heartbreaking play, a whistle sounds
a truce. The teams are rushed to the gym, quickly
sponged, fresh recruits jump into the ranks of the scrubs,
and once more the regulars are put to the relentless
test.</p>

<p>“If we can live through this,” gasps one of the regulars
as, the playing over for the day, he totters in the
direction of the showers, “if we can live through this
we’ll eat up any eleven on earth.”</p>

<p>“Are you satisfied, Chip?” queried the weary, exultant
Handy as he came, clothed for the street, out of
the dressing rooms after the Wednesday game.</p>

<p>“Yes,” Merry answered, “we’ve got a bunch of winners.
All aboard for Dolliver’s to-morrow afternoon.”</p>

<p>“The word has been passed around, Chip, and we’ll
all be ready.”</p>

<p>Thursday afternoon Bradlaugh’s big car, and two
other machines pressed into service, carried the Ophir
eleven, three or four substitutes, and Chip Merriwell and
his chums out along the old trail to Tinaja Wells.</p>

<p>A disappointment awaited Frank at Dolliver’s. He
had counted upon meeting Darrel at the ranch, but Darrel,
he found, had gone into Gold Hill that very morning.</p>

<p>Why was Darrel in Gold Hill? Certainly his uncle<span class="pagenum" id="Page_283">283</span>
had not sent for him. The colonel was still clinging
to Jode Lenning, and, so long as he did that, he could
have no possible use for Darrel.</p>

<p>Merry, however, had too much on his mind to worry
over the mysterious actions of Darrel. Curly was improving
right along, and that was the main thing. He
would undoubtedly be at the Ophir-Gold Hill game, and
Merry could see him there.</p>

<p>Thursday there was nothing at all to do, with the exception
of a little signal practice along toward sun-down.
Nor was there any line-up or hard work on
Friday—nothing but a five-mile cross-country trot in
the forenoon, and in the afternoon nothing at all. It
was the day before the game—a day to which the population
of Ophir and Gold Hill had been looking forward
for months.</p>

<p>The game was to be played on the Ophir field. The
games of the two previous years had been won by Gold
Hill on her own field, and it was deemed no more than
fair that Ophir should have the third game on her
grounds.</p>

<p>The fellows were to remain at Dolliver’s until one
o’clock Saturday afternoon. At that hour the machines
were to arrive for them and whisk them away to the
field for the fight with their rivals.</p>

<p>There was not much hilarity among the lads. They
were impressed—and a little oppressed—with the prospect
of the work required of them on the next afternoon.
They collected in groups, and, in low voices,
talked of everything they could think of except football.
And yet, the biggest and most constant thing in
every fellow’s mind was the coming game.</p>

<p>Merry and Handy, along about eight in the evening,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_284">284</span>
were a little apart from the players. They were considering
Simeon Guffey for about the dozenth time.</p>

<p>“You’re fretting too much about the Gold Hill coach,
old man,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“I’ve got a hunch that there’s something about the fellow
we don’t understand,” answered the captain.</p>

<p>“If you’re going to worry about all the things you
can’t understand,” Merry laughed, “you’re going to have
your hands full.”</p>

<p>Just at that moment Clancy came around a corner
of the house.</p>

<p>“Guess who’s here, Chip!” said he.</p>

<p>“I’m in no mood to wrestle with conundrums, Clan,”
was the answer.</p>

<p>“All right, then. It’s Colonel Hawtrey. He just rode
up. His horse is at the hitching pole and he wants to
see you at once—and privately.”</p>

<p>“Hawtrey—to see me!” Frank muttered, as he hurried
around the house and toward the trail in front.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_285">285</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLIV" id="CHAPTER_XLIV">CHAPTER XLIV.</a><br />

<small>THE COLONEL’S TIP.</small></h2>


<p>The colonel, erect and soldierly, was pacing slowly
back and forth at the trailside. It was a fair inference,
from the way he bore himself, that there was something
on his mind.</p>

<p>Since Frank had heard of the way the old colonel had
been treating Jode Lenning, following Jode’s wretched
conduct in the gulch, his estimate of the colonel had gone
down several degrees. A man might be eccentric, Frank
reasoned, without displaying such glaring partiality or
such weak-kneed injustice.</p>

<p>“Good evening, colonel,” said Frank, coming to a halt
near the trail.</p>

<p>The other, busy with his reflections, had not noticed
the lad’s approach. “That you, Merriwell?” he asked,
turning.</p>

<p>“Yes, sir. I was told that you want to talk with
me.”</p>

<p>“So I do; I have come out here for that especial
purpose. Suppose we walk a little way along the trail?”</p>

<p>Frank fell in at the colonel’s side and walked with him
a stone’s throw up the road. When they halted, the
colonel sat down on a bowlder and lighted a cigar. The
flare of the match, falling over his rugged face, revealed
a sternness and a settled purpose that rather startled the
youngster at his side. Colonel Hawtrey, in spite of the
way he was treating Jode, was no weakling.</p>

<p>“To-morrow, Merriwell,” went on Hawtrey,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_286">286</span> “is the
day of the big game. Several hundred from Gold Hill
will move on Ophir to root for the home team. I hope
everybody keeps his temper and that there will be no
disgraceful clashes. To-morrow afternoon, I sincerely
trust, we are going to bury our animosities in friendly
rivalry. The old feud between the two athletic organizations,
let us hope, is going to be wiped out forever.”</p>

<p>“You will find, colonel,” said Frank, “that Ophir will
do her full part.”</p>

<p>“Glad to hear that. I will personally stand sponsor
for Gold Hill. The news comes to us that your team
is in a bad way, and that last week Saturday the first
game after your return to town from camp was a big
disappointment to you. Handy, your captain, got rattled
and began interfering with the quarter back, and Mayburn,
your center, put up a miserable article of play. Is
that right?”</p>

<p>The hot blood rushed into Merry’s face and he shot
an indignant glance at the colonel. What was the use
of the Gold Hill nabob coming out to Dolliver’s to talk
such stuff to the Ophir coach?</p>

<p>“How did you get any information about that game,
colonel?” he demanded. “No one was allowed on the
grounds except our men. I can’t believe that our fellows
would talk about what happened last Saturday
afternoon.”</p>

<p>“Ordinary loyalty would keep them from doing that,
eh?”</p>

<p>“Sure it would. Who told you all that, sir?”</p>

<p>“That’s immaterial, just now. I am not here to twit
you about your team’s shortcomings, Merriwell. I have
simply recited what came to me as facts, and I want you
to say whether or not the facts are true. A good deal
hangs upon that point—more than you even dream of.”</p>

<p>There was a depth of earnestness in the colone<span class="pagenum" id="Page_287">287</span>l’s
voice which filled Frank with wonder. What in blazes
was he trying to get at, anyhow?</p>

<p>“Why, yes,” said Frank, “Harry did interfere a little
with the quarter, and Mayburn was off in his work.”</p>

<p>“Doolittle wasn’t very good, either, was he?”</p>

<p>“Not very.”</p>

<p>The colonel drew a long breath and puffed silently at
his cigar for a few moments.</p>

<p>“Then what I heard was true,” he muttered finally.
“This makes it certain, my lad, that Gold Hill had a
spy at your secret game. How could anything be known
about the game if that had not been the case? Such
work is reprehensible. I am as indignant over the matter
as you could possibly be. There is nothing sportsmanlike
about it. I can congratulate myself on the fact,
however, that the spy was not a Gold Hill man but a
stranger—or almost a stranger. I am positive that it
was Guffey, the coach.”</p>

<p>“You think, then, that Guffey was sneaking around
when we played that game, last week?” the boy demanded.</p>

<p>“I’m sure of it. Guffey left Gold Hill in the forenoon
of Saturday, and he did not return until Sunday forenoon.
He was in Ophir—he must have been.”</p>

<p>“I knew he was in Ophir Saturday night,” said Frank,
and told of what happened in the rear of the hotel
on Sunday morning.</p>

<p>The colonel muttered angrily to himself.</p>

<p>“That’s the sort of gentleman we have for a coach,”
he growled,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_288">288</span> “a fellow who uses a ‘hypoderm’ and who
sleeps in a box in a back yard. He’s a hobo, and a pretty
poor stick of a hobo at that. This thing is working out
just as I thought it would. Good may come of it, however.”</p>

<p>“Where does this man Guffey hail from, colonel?”
Frank asked.</p>

<p>“I don’t know the first thing about him. Jode knows
him, and he’s the one who sent for him. Guffey’s a
good coach, and our eleven is in better shape than it
has ever been before. I’m sorry that Guffey’s a scoundrel,
but it is going to be the happiest day of my life
if he pans out the way I hope and believe.”</p>

<p>Once more the colonel had Frank wondering. How
was he expecting Guffey to “pan out?” In one breath
the colonel was sorry Guffey was a scoundrel, and in the
next he was going to be happy if the scoundrel panned
out to be as bad as he hoped and believed. Frank was
all twisted to account for the colonel’s motives and feelings.</p>

<p>“Now that you know Guffey’s a scoundrel,” Frank remarked,
“are you going to let him come to Ophir with
the Gold Hill fellows?”</p>

<p>“I am,” was the reply, “and while he’s in your bailiwick,
Merriwell, I want you to do one thing.”</p>

<p>“What is that?”</p>

<p>“Watch the fellow. You’re a friend of my nephew,
Ellis, aren’t you?”</p>

<p>“Right from the top of the hat,” said Frank, with
spirit.</p>

<p>“Well, keep a keen eye on Guffey. By doing that, you
may help Darrel more than you can realize now. You’re
very much concerned, I suppose, because I have treated
Jode, since that affair in the gulch, with the same consideration
that I did before. You don’t understand why
I have left him on the football team, or why I have
anything further to do with him. Is that correct?”</p>

<p>“Well, yes,” admitted Frank.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_289">289</span></p>

<p>“And neither can you understand why I tolerate such
a scoundrel as Guffey.”</p>

<p>“No, colonel, I can’t.”</p>

<p>“I am manipulating things, Merriwell. I may be
wrong, but I don’t think so. If you will coöperate with
me, I’m pretty sure this whole affair is going to come
around in fine shape.”</p>

<p>“Just what do you expect me to do?” Frank queried.
“How will keeping an eye on Guffey enable me to coöperate
with you?”</p>

<p>“Why, as to that, everything depends on your shrewdness.
Take up a position close to Guffey from the time
he arrives on the field; then watch him like a hawk. If
anything develops that excites your suspicion, follow it
up with vigor.”</p>

<p>“What do you think will develop?”</p>

<p>“I haven’t the least notion what form developments
will take, but I am sure something will come. I have
done my part by tolerating Jode and helping to get
Guffey here. Now the rest of it is up to you—and you
are a good friend of Darrel’s.”</p>

<p>Frank was nonplused. It had been made clear to him,
however, that the colonel had let Jode off easy, after that
affair in the gulch, for a purpose; and, for the same
purpose, he had allowed Jode to have his way about
Guffey. Here the wily old colonel was playing a deep
game. And at the back of his head was the desire that
Darrel might profit by it. While this much was clear;
to Merry, all the rest was steeped in the deepest kind
of mystery.</p>

<p>“Are you going to take my tip, Merriwell, and act upon
it?” asked the colonel.</p>

<p>“Bank on that, sir!” was the prompt response.</p>

<p>“Good!” said the colonel, in a tone of deep satisfac<span class="pagenum" id="Page_290">290</span>tion.
“If I’ve got hold of the right end of this, I can
trust you to work out the rest of the problem.”</p>

<p>“Will Guffey get actively into the game?” inquired
Frank.</p>

<p>“No,” was the decided answer. “It’s bad enough to
have such a fellow coach our boys without coming actually
into contact with them on the field. As soon as this
game is over, I can promise you that Gold Hill will see
the last of him. Darrel, I hear, is not at Dolliver’s?”
the colonel went on, shifting the subject.</p>

<p>“No,” said Frank.</p>

<p>“Is he in Ophir?”</p>

<p>“Dolliver tells me that he went to Gold Hill Thursday
morning.”</p>

<p>“Jove! I haven’t seen him in Gold Hill, and I haven’t
heard of his being there. You are sure Dolliver——”</p>

<p>“Darrel won’t go looking for you, colonel,” said Frank,
with a touch of pride, “until he’s able to give you his
hand. I believe he went to the Hill to try and clear up
that forgery matter.”</p>

<p>“Ah!” There was a certain grimness in the colonel’s
voice which did not escape Frank. “I don’t believe he
can do that, Merriwell. He hadn’t ought to be roaming
around, anyhow, until that broken arm of his is entirely
well. He’ll be at Ophir for the game?”</p>

<p>“He said he would, at the time we broke camp and
pulled out for home.”</p>

<p>The colonel got up and stepped closer to Frank. His
voice sank low and throbbed with feeling as he laid a
hand on Frank’s shoulder and went on:</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_291">291</span></p>
<p>“If you see him, Merriwell, tell him not to draw any
wrong conclusions from the way I am conducting myself.
Tell him that, when he knows all, he will see that
I am acting for the best interests of all concerned.
You’ll do that?”</p>

<p>“Certainly.”</p>

<p>“I’ve been an old fool in a good many ways, and when
an old fool sees the light he ought to be wise in getting
to the bottom of things and in passing justice around.
I’m trying to show a little wisdom, Merriwell. Until
you know all, you can at least give me credit for that.”</p>

<p>“I do, colonel,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>The colonel reached for his hand, shook it warmly,
and then, without speaking further, turned and retraced
his way to his horse. Frank, standing to one side,
watched while he swung into the saddle.</p>

<p>“Good-by, my lad, and good luck,” called the colonel.</p>

<p>“Good-by, sir,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>The next moment Colonel Hawtrey had galloped off
along the trail and was lost in the wavering shadows.
He left behind him, perhaps as puzzled a boy as there
was in all Arizona.</p>

<p>“Well, I’ll be hanged!” Merriwell muttered, as he
turned back toward the house. “The colonel’s all right,
but I wish to thunder that I knew what he’s trying to
get at. Going it blind never made much of a hit with
me.”</p>

<h2 id="CHAPTER_XLV">CHAPTER XLV.</h2>

<p>THE PLUGGED “HALF.”</p>


<p>The noon meal at Dolliver’s was a light one, for Frank
did not believe in football on a full stomach. The three
big cars came along, promptly on time, and the lads
crowded into them with their suit cases. They were a
nervous lot of boys in spite of their efforts to be cool
and confident.</p>

<p>Frank got into a front seat of the Bradlaugh car. Mr.
Bradlaugh was driving.</p>

<p>“This outfit is looking mighty fit, I must say,” the
president of the O.  A.  C. remarked, as he put the automobile
in motion on the back track.</p>

<p>“The Ophir fellows are ready to make the fight of
their lives,” Frank answered.</p>

<p>“Bully. About all of Gold Hill was piling into our
club grounds when I left. They’re always a talkative
lot and not too careful how they rag the Ophir players.
We must all remember to take the joshing in good
part.”</p>

<p>“You can depend on us to prove a credit to Ophir, Mr.
Bradlaugh,” said Frank quietly.</p>

<p>“It does me good to hear that. Win or lose, Merriwell,
let’s show the colonel and his crowd that we are
true sportsmen. The colonel is always harping on that
proposition, you know, so let’s give him an example of
what it really means.”</p>

<p>“We will.”</p>

<p>The game was called for two-thirty, and it was two
o’clock when the three automobiles trailed into the in<span class="pagenum" id="Page_293">293</span>closure
at the athletic field, trailed in single file across
one end of the grounds and halted at the doors of the
gym.</p>

<p>Grand stand and bleachers were swarming with people.
The crowd overflowed the clubhouse balcony, filled a
number of automobiles that nosed the fence beyond the
side lines, and took up every available foot of ground
that commanded a view of the gridiron.</p>

<p>Pennants were waving, handkerchiefs were being fluttered,
and cheers were going up on every side. The
arrival of Ophir’s champions was the signal for a bedlam
of cheers that traveled across the field and back again
in a tidal wave.</p>

<p>“They look good, but not good enough!” howled a
Gold Hiller as the cheering lulled.</p>

<p>“You can’t produce anythin’ to beat ’em!” whooped
a scrappy Ophir man.</p>

<p>“Hold yer bronks till the other crowd trots out!”</p>

<p>“We’ll hold our bronks, and our eleven’ll hold yore
team to a fare-ye-well!”</p>

<p>“Wait an’ see!”</p>

<p>“Yes, wait!”</p>

<p>This was a sample of the cross-fire indulged in by the
rival rooters. Cowboys and miners were among the
partisans, on both sides, and they were of a class not
given to undue restraint.</p>

<p>“Hawkins is on the ground with a force of helpers,”
said Mr. Bradlaugh, as Merry climbed out of the car,
“and if the good feeling happens to get strained I reckon
the deputy can smooth it out.”</p>

<p>“If there’s any row,” said Frank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_294">294</span> “it will be among
the rough-necks. There’s no bitterness in our crowd.
We’re going to win, and we know it. That’s all, Mr.
Bradlaugh.”</p>

<p>“That’s enough,” laughed Mr. Bradlaugh, with an
admiring glance at Merry as he trailed the Ophir fellows
into the gymnasium.</p>

<p>Frank was not intending to get into the game himself,
but as good substitutes were lacking, he had planned
to hold Clancy and Ballard, along with a few of the best
second eleven men, in reserve.</p>

<p>While the fellows were in the dressing rooms, getting
out of their ordinary clothes and into their football togs,
Chip sat in the big, bare exercise room, his head bowed
in thought. Some one approached him from behind and
touched his shoulder.</p>

<p>“Not gloomy are you, old chap?” asked a familiar
voice.</p>

<p>Frank whirled and sprang up.</p>

<p>“Hello, Curly!” he exclaimed, his face flushing with
pleasure. “Where the deuce have you been keeping yourself
for the last few days?”</p>

<p>“Left Dolliver’s to go to Gold Hill on business, pard,”
smiled Darrel.</p>

<p>The youngster’s face was pale and a little thinner than
usual. His bandaged arm swung from his neck in a
sling.</p>

<p>“I was badly disappointed when I did not see you at
the ranch,” Frank went on, taking the other’s hand.
“How are you feeling?”</p>
<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_295">295</span></p>
<p>“Finer than silk. A little wabbly on my pins, but
that’s only temporary. I’m here to see the game, but
I’ve been hanging around the gym to tell you that I
don’t like the way this man Guffey sizes up. I’ve got
some mighty strong doubts about him. When I heard a
new coach had arrived in Gold Hill, and that Jode had
signaled him to come I was filled with suspicions. That’s
why I went over to the Hill. But the suspicions didn’t
work out worth a darn. Yesterday I headed for Ophir.”</p>

<p>“What were the suspicions, Curly?”</p>

<p>“Never mind, now. I seem to be full of pipe dreams.
Say, what do you think about Jode and the colonel? You
know, of course, that Jode’s still king bee of the Gold
Hill bunch. He’s got a stranglehold on the colonel, all
right!”</p>

<p>A shadow crossed Darrel’s face. Through it showed
disappointment and a little sadness.</p>

<p>“When I heard how your uncle had treated Jode,
after that eye opener in the gulch,” Frank returned, “I
had begun to think that the old colonel was in his dotage.
But now I’ve changed my mind.”</p>

<p>“What caused the change?”</p>

<p>“A talk I had with the colonel last night. He came
out to Dolliver’s purposely to have a word with me.”</p>

<p>Darrel showed symptoms of curiosity and excitement.</p>

<p>“What did he say, Chip?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I couldn’t tell you all he said, for I haven’t time, but
he gave me a message for you. He wanted me to say,
if I saw you before the game, that you’re not to draw
any wrong conclusion from the way he has been behaving;
he said that, when you know all, you’ll see how
he’s acting for the best interests of all concerned.”</p>

<p>“That’s mighty hard to swallow,” said Darrel, with
a trace of bitterness. “I saved his life when Jode failed,
and yet he keeps right on with Jode just as he was doing
before. I’m not finding any fault with him—he’s his
own boss, and I’ve nothing to say. But I’m not the
only one that’s doing a heap of guessing because of the
way he’s acting.”</p>

<p>“Don’t form any snap judgments, Curly,” urged
Frank.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_296">296</span> “Wait for a while, anyhow.”</p>

<p>“Oh, I’ll wait,” was the hopeless response. “What
can I do but wait? But I’m pretty near discouraged.
That forgery plot was too deep, too well laid. We’ll
never get to the bottom of it.”</p>

<p>“Buck up, old man! We will get to the bottom of
it—mark what I’m telling you.”</p>

<p>At this point the Ophir eleven and the substitutes
trooped from the dressing rooms. Although Darrel belonged
with Gold Hill, yet he was not an active Gold
Hiller, and a lot of his warmest friendships were
wrapped up in the Ophir team. The boy was a prime
favorite, and the players flocked around him and pressed
his hand cordially. Darrel, with a laughing remark to the
effect that he wished the Ophir fellows all sorts of luck,
excused himself and hurriedly left the gym.</p>

<p>The time had come for a final word with the eleven.
Handy eased himself first of what was on his mind.
He recalled the fact that Ophir had been beaten twice
by the Gold Hillers. Would Ophir stand for that kind
of thing three times hand running? He thought not.
With a few words of counsel here and there, he stepped
back and gave place to Merriwell.</p>

<p>“You know what the effect will be, fellows,” said
Frank, “if you fall down on this game?”</p>

<p>A chorus of affirmatives greeted the question.</p>

<p>“I guess I don’t have to say anything more,” Frank
added. “Get together, that’s all. You can win, and
you’re going to.”</p>

<p>Just as he finished, a tumult of shouts and cheers
came from the spectators. One look from the gym door
showed that the Gold Hill team had trotted out on the
field from their dressing rooms. They made a fine spectacle,
and, all in all, looked to be the formidable crowd
that they were.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_297">297</span></p>

<p>Not only was Gold Hill cheering the team, but Ophir
also had risen to its feet and joined in with the rival
rooters. This augured well for the feeling that prevailed
among the spectators.</p>

<p>After a few moments, the Gold Hill squad scattered
over the gridiron for a little signal work.</p>

<p>“Now, then, fellows,” said Handy.</p>

<p>As the Ophir lads appeared, there was another round
of cheering; but the volume of sound and the enthusiasm
were no greater than in the case of their opponents.
At sight of the Ophir squad, the Gold Hill players
bunched together and gave them their club yell in a most
friendly spirit. Jode Lenning himself, who was always
more or less of a disturbing factor, led in the demonstration.</p>

<p>Handy, not to be outdone by the rivals, bunched up
his men and returned the Gold Hill greeting.</p>

<p>“Gee,” laughed Clancy, at Merry’s elbow, “you’d never
have thought, a spell ago, that these two clubs were
ready to fly at each other’s throats! The proper spirit
prevails in wads and slathers.”</p>

<p>“This is merely by way of shaking hands before the
bout,” smiled Merry. “The test will come when we get
down to business.”</p>

<p>While the Ophirites were being put through a few
of their paces, Merry started in to fulfill his promise to
Colonel Hawtrey. He began looking for Guffey.</p>

<p>The other coach found him first, and came forward
smilingly and with outstretched hand.</p>

<p>“Hello, Merriwell,” said he pleasantly. “This is a
bully day for a game, and a bully crowd of spectators.”</p>

<p>“You’re right,” Merry answered.</p>

<p>He kept close to Guffey, in an artless sort of way,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_298">298</span>
and was with him when Lenning and Handy approached
to toss for positions.</p>

<p>“Got a dollar, Guff?” inquired Lenning.</p>

<p>“Here’s a half, Len,” answered the coach, dipping into
his pocket.</p>

<p>The coin was sent spinning into the air, and, when
it fell, it was almost at Merriwell’s feet.</p>

<p>Lenning won, and naturally he chose the goal that
had the wind in its favor. The players scattered out
on the field, and Merry was left staring at Guffey—startled
so that he scarcely realized what was going on
around him.</p>

<p>The coin which Guffey had furnished for the toss was
the plugged half dollar, Merry’s pocket piece, and the
one that had vanished with the rest of the money from
Merry’s coat. Frank had had a good look at the coin,
and could not be mistaken.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_299">299</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVI" id="CHAPTER_XLVI">CHAPTER XLVI.</a><br />

<small>THE GAME.</small></h2>


<p>Merriwell’s interest in that game was naturally intense;
and yet, it was not so intense as it was in that
affair of Darrel’s. The colonel had hinted that Darrel
was to be benefited by Merriwell’s watching Guffey.
Keeping an eye on the other coach had started something,
right at the very beginning of the game.</p>

<p>Like lightning Merry’s mind marshaled a few facts
and evolved a startling theory. Hawtrey had said that
Guffey had seen the game on the preceding Saturday.
Merriwell’s thirty dollars had vanished during that
game. Now Guffey had produced some of the loose
change that had formed part of the “thirty.” It was
money that could not readily be passed, so here was a
possible reason for Guffey’s keeping it by him.</p>

<p>The pockets of the coat were emptied while the garment
lay on the grand-stand benches. Instantly Merriwell
thought of the dressing rooms under the stand,
and of their possibilities as a point of observation. He
thought, too, how easy it would be for a thief to reach
out and draw the coat through between the seats, go
into the garment at his leisure, and then replace it where
it had been left by its owner.</p>

<p>Everything pointed to the fact that Simeon Guffey
had taken the money. Frank had to believe the evidence.
He stepped closer to the Gold Hill coach, who
was watching the game with an absorbed air.</p>

<p>Ophir had got the Gold Hill kick-off and had run
the ball back past the middle of the field, losing it after<span class="pagenum" id="Page_300">300</span>
two downs by an on-side kick that failed to pan out as
expected.</p>

<p>“Now, then, Gold Hill, smash into ’em! Get the
steam engine to work! Flatten ’em out!” roared the
visiting rooters.</p>

<p>“Hold ’em, Ophir!” came encouragingly from the
local ranks.</p>

<p>Gold Hill smashed into a stone wall when Ophir took
the defensive; but a breach was made, and Mingo, the
Gold Hill half back, made some good gains by clever
work. But Gold Hill, strongly favored by the wind,
elected to punt in the hope of getting within scoring
distance.</p>

<p>The ball gyrated through a long, high, aërial arc, to
be captured on the Ophir fifteen-yard line and hustled
back to the twenty-five yards before the runner was
downed.</p>

<p>“Whoop-ya!” howled cowboys in the Ophir crowd;
“eat ‘em up, you Ophir gophers! Swaller ’em, boots
an’ chaps! You can do it!”</p>

<p>“I got a ten-case note what says they kain’t do it!”
yelped a sporty miner from the Gold Hill benches.</p>

<p>“Make it a hundred an’ I’ll go ye!”</p>

<p>But evidently the other man couldn’t dig up the hundred.</p>

<p>Guffey, crouching on the side lines, was absently picking
pebbles out of the sand and flipping them about. He
seemed surprised by Ophir’s showing. Merry crouched
down at his side.</p>

<p>“You’ve done wonders with that bunch since last week,
Merriwell,” remarked Guffey.</p>

<p>He must have spoken before he thought. The next
instant his jaw muscles flexed angrily, and his pallid
face showed something like consternation.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_301">301</span></p>

<p>“What do you know about our work last week, Guffey?”
Frank asked.</p>

<p>He was so close to the other coach that it was not
difficult for him to make himself heard in spite of the
tumult caused by the spectators. One side or the other
was howling and cheering, so that the uproar was almost
continuous.</p>

<p>“Only—what I’ve heard,” answered Guffey, with some
nervousness and constraint.</p>

<p>“You heard our eleven was poor?”</p>

<p>Guffey affected not to catch the question. He pretended
to be wrapped up in the playing.</p>

<p>Ophir, from the twenty-five yards, had failed to gain,
and punted. Gold Hill got the ball on her forty-yard
line, and, after two trials that fell short, kicked again.
The ball sailed over the goal line, and Ophir touched it
back.</p>

<p>There came a bit of a lull. Frank pushed closer to
Guffey.</p>

<p>“I say, Guffey,” said he, “will you let me look at that
half dollar that was used for the toss?”</p>

<p>The Gold Hill coach turned his deathlike face toward
Frank, and peered at him with suspicion in his faded
blue eyes.</p>

<p>“You think it’s a fake coin, eh?” he demanded; “one
of the heads-I-win-tails-you-lose sort, eh?”</p>

<p>There was a snarl, venomous as it was uncalled for,
back of the words.</p>

<p>“I don’t think anything of the sort,” Frank answered
sharply. “I just want to look at it, that’s all.”</p>

<p>“There you are.”</p>

<p>Guffey thrust his hand into his pocket, jerked out a
coin, and flung it down in front of Frank. The latter
picked it up.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_302">302</span></p>

<p>It was not a plugged coin, nor was it minted in the
year of Merry’s birth. Guffey had substituted another
piece for the one in question.</p>

<p>“This isn’t the half they used for the toss, Guffey,”
said Frank.</p>

<p>“I’m a liar, am I?” demanded Guffey hotly. “What
are you trying to do, Merriwell? Kick up a row?”</p>

<p>“No,” was the response, “I don’t want any row here
to-day. Just let me see the half dollar that was used
for the toss.”</p>

<p>“You’ve seen it.”</p>

<p>With that Guffey arose from his crouching position,
and, with a scowl, moved off to another place. Frank
knew that the fellow was guilty. He had seen Frank
eying the plugged coin when it dropped in front of him,
and he had reasoned that he might have recognized it.
Frank’s request to see the silver piece was further proof
to Guffey that he had developed a suspicious interest in
it. Hence, Guffey’s motive for substituting another half
dollar for the right one.</p>

<p>Ophir, after the touchback, had elected to put the pigskin
in scrimmage, on the twenty-five yard line, but was
soon back at its old punting tricks. Gold Hill’s right
half, Poindexter by name, misjudged the ball. As it
slipped from the ends of his fingers, he was pushed aside
by an Ophir lad, who got it under him on Gold Hill’s
forty-yard line.</p>

<p>Ophir went wild. The stands fairly roared, hats were
tossed in the air, and yells and cheers made the whole
place a pandemonium.</p>

<p>“What’s up between Guffey and you, Chip?” queried
Clancy, in Merriwell’s ear.</p>

<p>“Why?” returned Merry.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_303">303</span> “What makes you think
there’s anything up, Clan?”</p>

<p>“Blazes! Why, I can’t help but see when it’s going
on right under my eyes.”</p>

<p>“Watch the game, Clan,” said Merry. “If I have to
leave the field, you stand by to send in the substitutes.”</p>

<p>“Look here,” muttered the excited Clancy, “you don’t
intend to clear out before the game’s over, do you?”</p>

<p>“I don’t know what will happen, Clan, but if I leave
it will be to follow Guffey. Don’t ask any questions.
I’m playing a bigger game than this little match at football.”</p>

<p>The red-headed fellow was all up in the air. His
freckled face reflected his conflicting emotions.</p>

<p>Frank, turning to keep track of Guffey, saw Hawkins,
the deputy sheriff, beckoning to him. He got up and
walked over to the deputy’s side.</p>

<p>“I’m keepin’ an eye on that Guffey person, Merriwell,”
said Hawkins. “You don’t need to bother.”</p>

<p>“What are you watching him for, Hawkins?” Frank
asked.</p>

<p>“Because I don’t like his looks. He’s a pill.”</p>

<p>“He’s the Gold Hill coach, and you’re not to interfere
with him, you know.”</p>

<p>“Mebby not, but what’re you baitin’ him for?”</p>

<p>They were both unconsciously peering toward Guffey.
At that moment, the Gold Hill coach turned suddenly
and gave the two of them a full, level stare. When
he turned away, he acted like a person who is considerably
wrought up and trying to conceal it.</p>

<p>“Wow!” chuckled Hawkins. “Say, son, he don’t like
seein’ you and me in talk, like this. He’s makin’ a bluff
that he don’t care—but it’s a bluff. Why does he care?
You better tell me.”</p>

<p>“Not now,” said Frank, and walked away.</p>

<p>Meanwhile the quarter had ended with the ball on<span class="pagenum" id="Page_304">304</span>
Gold Hill’s fifty-yard line. On the first play, Bradlaugh,
left half for Ophir, carried the oval for a ten-yard
gain. Little by little, steady as fate, the ball crept
to within ten yards of the Gold Hill goal line.</p>

<p>Frank’s interest, for a while, almost turned from Guffey
to the ball. It looked as though Ophir was surely
due to make a touchdown.</p>

<p>The spectators had gone crazy with excitement. Gold
Hill’s players were fighting like so many tigers; and
then, out of the ruck of fighting and the tangle of sweating
players, the ball soared up and over the field. Ophir
groaned and Gold Hill began to jubilate.</p>

<p>That was the only time either goal had been in serious
danger, and the half ended with the ball at about the
place where it had been when first put into play.</p>

<p>Merriwell led his men to the dressing rooms.</p>

<p>“Fine work!” said he. “You’re going to get a touchdown
in the next half, and Gold Hill isn’t going to score
at all. I’ve got a hunch—one of the red-hot kind that
always pans out. Mayburn, you’re a crackajack! Spink,
just keep up the good work! Brad, you’re a star! What’s
the matter, Deever?”</p>

<p>Lafe Deever, right end, was limping.</p>

<p>“Twisted my ankle,” said he, “but I reckon it won’t
amount to much.”</p>

<p>“Take off your shoe and let’s see.”</p>

<p>Merry shook his head when he examined the exposed
foot. The skin was broken and the ankle looked red
and angry.</p>

<p>“Let Banks report to the referee, Handy,” said Frank.
“Sorry, Deever,” he added, to the crestfallen end, “but
we can’t take chances, you know. You’ve won glory
enough in the first half, anyhow.”</p>

<p>Merry pulled Handy aside.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_305">305</span></p>

<p>“If anything happens that I have to leave the field
before the game is over, Handy,” said Frank, “Clancy
will be on deck.”</p>

<p>“But you’re not going to leave——”</p>

<p>“Not if I can help it. There’s something important
going on—something not down on the bills—and I can’t
neglect it even for this football game.”</p>

<p>With that, Merry hurried from the gym. The first
man he encountered on the field was Hawkins.</p>

<p>“Has Guffey come out of the Gold Hill dressing rooms
yet?” he asked.</p>

<p>“Well, I reckon,” grinned the deputy. “He came
out with Jode Lenning, an’ the two walked over to’rd
the west end of the grand stand. There they are now, in
a close confab.”</p>

<p>Frank sauntered carelessly in the direction of Guffey
and Lenning.</p>

<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_306">306</span></p>




<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVII" id="CHAPTER_XLVII">CHAPTER XLVII.</a><br />

<small>NOT ON THE PROGRAM.</small></h2>


<p>Over their shoulders, Lenning and Guffey caught sight
of Merriwell making his way toward them. They exchanged
hurried words, and Guffey turned from Lenning
and started to leave the field around the lower end
of the grand stand.</p>

<p>Frank quickened his pace a little. Lenning walked
hurriedly toward Frank. He was plainly nervous and
worried, and his shifty eyes held a harassed look.</p>

<p>“Where’s Guffey going?” Merry inquired, when Lenning
was close enough to hear.</p>

<p>“He’s sick and is going around back of the stand to
lie down,” was the answer. “He’s subject to spells with
his head, and he’s got a bad one coming on now. He’ll
be back before the last half’s over.”</p>

<p>Merriwell went on. Lenning watched him with growing
suspicion.</p>

<p>“Are you going after him, Merriwell?” he asked.</p>

<p>“I want to talk with him,” Frank replied indefinitely.</p>

<p>“He’s in no shape to talk. He——”</p>

<p>But Merriwell, by then, was out of earshot. The call
for the second half was ringing down the field. Lenning
hesitated, as though inclined to follow Merriwell; then,
tossing his hands with a desperate gesture, he whirled
and ran to take his place with the rest of the Gold Hill
team.</p>

<p>When Frank had worked his way past the lower end
of the grand stand, he half started toward the dressing
rooms. But he checked the move, for Guffey, as he<span class="pagenum" id="Page_307">307</span>
could see, was traveling north across the sandy stretch
of ground on that side of the club premises.</p>

<p>Lenning had misstated the case. The Gold Hill coach
may have been having “a spell with his head,” but he
was not bound for the dressing rooms to lie down. On
the contrary, he was striding briskly off into the open,
apparently bent on getting as far away from the football
field as possible.</p>

<p>Merriwell chuckled grimly. He had thought that a
maneuver of this kind would be attempted.</p>

<p>What he had said about the half dollar had certainly
worked upon Guffey’s suspicions; and then, the suspicions
must have been intensified when Guffey saw Frank
talking with Hawkins, the deputy sheriff.</p>

<p>Undoubtedly the Gold Hill coach thought that a plan
was forming to put him under arrest for stealing the
thirty dollars. In order to avoid such a result, Guffey’s
best plan, of course, was to get himself out of the way.
This, very likely, was what he was attempting to do.</p>

<p>Guffey, casting a hurried look behind him, saw Merriwell.
He began to run.</p>

<p>“Hold up, Guffey!” Merry shouted. “Don’t be in a
rush.”</p>

<p>But Guffey was attending to a matter of pressing importance.
If overtaken, a jail would yawn to receive
him; on the other hand, if he succeeded in making his
escape from Merriwell, he would perhaps receive the
benefit of a doubt in the matter of that thirty dollars.
Instead of halting, he increased his pace to the limit.</p>

<p>There must have been some exciting work going forward
on the football field. The roar of the spectators
mounted high, and never for a moment were grand stand
and bleachers entirely quiet. The noise lessened as Merriwell
and Guffey drew farther and farther away.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_308">308</span></p>

<p>Merry, it was soon demonstrated, was a faster runner
than Guffey, for at every stride he was gaining upon
him. It was presently evident, too, that Merry was also
a better jumper.</p>

<p>Ahead of Guffey lay an eight-foot irrigation ditch,
filled to the brim with flowing water. The Gold Hill
coach attempted to take it at a leap, but he took off too
soon; then, on top of that, his foot slipped as he sprang
into the air. It happened, therefore, that instead of
landing safely on the opposite bank, he dropped squarely
into the water.</p>

<p>For a moment he was under the surface, and all that
was to be seen was his cap, floating away with the sluggish
tide. Frank jumped the ditch and stood waiting
on the opposite bank.</p>

<p>Guffey bobbed up, thoroughly drenched, and sputtering.
Seeing Merriwell waiting for him, he turned to
reach the other bank. To his astonishment—and somewhat
to Merriwell’s, as well—Hawkins, the deputy
sheriff, appeared abruptly and headed him off in that
direction.</p>

<p>“What are you chumps trying to do?” sputtered Guffey.</p>

<p>“Tryin’ to git hands on you, Guffey,” answered Hawkins,
with a grin. “If you think you’ve been in long
enough, why not come out? Jumpin’ sand hills! What’s
the matter with your hair?”</p>

<p>This was a question which Frank had been asking
himself. The water had played sad pranks with Guffey’s
jet-black hair. In spots the black had all run out
of it, and had streaked his pale face, leaving a tow color
in place of the dark hue that had previously distinguished
the looks.</p>

<p>With a yell of consternation, Guffey put up his hands<span class="pagenum" id="Page_309">309</span>
to his face and then withdrew them and looked at his
smudged fingers.</p>

<p>“It ain’t right for a young feller to go dyin’ his hair
that-a-way,” said Hawkins. “Come on out. I shouldn’t
think it would be comfortable, stayin’ in there too long.”</p>

<p>“I’ll come out,” said Guffey savagely, “but you can’t
arrest me for taking Merriwell’s money.”</p>

<p>“That’s it, eh?” chuckled the deputy sheriff. “I thought
you’d done something to Merriwell that wasn’t exactly
honest.”</p>

<p>“He stole thirty dollars from me,” said Frank. “He’s
got a pocket piece of mine in his clothes, right this minute,
and that was part of the stolen money. He furnished
it for the toss, at the beginning of the football
game, and I had a good look at it.”</p>

<p>“A fellow in Gold Hill worked that off on me,” said
Guffey.</p>

<p>“He did, eh?” answered Frank grimly. “Then why
didn’t you show the half dollar to me when I asked
you? Why did you hand me another half, instead?”</p>

<p>“I did that by mistake,” was the lame excuse.</p>

<p>Guffey had splashed out of the ditch, and, dripping
and forlorn, was standing close to Hawkins.</p>

<p>“We’ll let that part go, for the present,” said Frank.
“Your real name is Billy Shoup, and not Sim Guffey.
If you will tell all you know about that forgery, and
the way you manipulated matters so as to make Ellis
Darrel appear guilty, we’ll drop the robbery matter.
What do you say?”</p>

<p>Guffey stood like a man in a trance. When he finally
recovered speech he persisted in declaring that he was
Guffey, and had never heard of the man called Shoup.</p>

<p>“What you need, Guffey,” grinned Frank,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_310">310</span> “is a change
of heart. Maybe that will come to you with a change of
clothes.”</p>

<p>He turned to Hawkins.</p>

<p>“Take charge of him, Hawkins,” he went on. “Take
him to the Ophir House, and stay with him until I come.
He knows all about that forgery business, and can clear
Ellis Darrel. He’ll do it, too, or he’ll be put in jail for
stealing that money from me.”</p>

<p>“I’ll hang onto him,” said Hawkins, “don’t fret about
that. Come on, Guffey—or Shoup—whichever it is.”</p>

<p>Guffey walked meekly away with the deputy sheriff,
trailing little streams of water behind him as he went.
Frank hastened back to the football field, arriving just
as Brad made the only touchdown of the game, and in
the last five minutes of play.</p>

<p>Bedlam was let loose. All the Ophir partisans rushed
into the field, caught their winning team up on their
shoulders, and raced the entire eleven around the cinder
track. Never before had Ophir experienced a day
like that.</p>

<p>There were many shouts for Merriwell, but Merry
was in the clubhouse. Hawtrey had caught him by the
arm and hustled him to a place where they could have
a few words in private.</p>

<p>Very briefly Frank told the colonel what had transpired
in the vicinity of the irrigation ditch. The colonel’s
face brightened wonderfully.</p>

<p>“I could have sworn it!” he exclaimed delightedly.
“We’ll pick up Ellis and Jode and get to the hotel as
soon as we can. I’m going to settle this affair now,
once and for all. Wait here, Merriwell, till I find the
others; then we’ll see how quick we can get to town.”</p>



<hr class="chap" />
<div class="chapter"></div>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_311">311</span></p>

<h2><a name="CHAPTER_XLVIII" id="CHAPTER_XLVIII">CHAPTER XLVIII.</a><br />

<small>ALL’S WELL THAT ENDS WELL.</small></h2>


<p>It was half an hour before the colonel had rounded up
the party he wished to take into Ophir with him, and
during that time Frank was being congratulated warmly
in the clubhouse on the success of the Ophir team. Mr.
Bradlaugh, staid old gentleman that he was, fairly took
the lad in his arms and gave him a hug.</p>

<p>“You did it, Merriwell,” he kept saying; “if it hadn’t
been for you we couldn’t have won.”</p>

<p>When the colonel finally arrived with Jode and Ellis,
Mr. Bradlaugh offered to give them a lift to the Ophir
House in his car. Clancy and Ballard appeared just in
time to form part of the load.</p>

<p>Merry’s chums had been wondering what it was that
could have taken their chum off the field during the last
half of that exciting game. Merriwell wouldn’t breathe
a word on the ride into town, but told them to wait a
little and the whole thing would be explained.</p>

<p>In less than fifteen minutes after leaving the clubhouse,
Colonel Hawtrey, his two nephews, Merriwell,
Clancy, and Ballard were ushered by Pophagan into a
room where Hawkins was keeping watch over Shoup,
alias Guffey.</p>

<p>Shoup had wrung out and dried off his clothes, and
he had likewise washed his face and removed the rest
of the color from his hair. The moment Jode Lenning
saw him, he sank limply into a chair, white to the lips.</p>

<p>“I know you, you contemptible cur,” cried the colonel,
shaking a finger in Shoup’s face.<span class="pagenum" id="Page_312">312</span> “You’re the fellow
who, more than a year ago, brought a forged check
to me and said my nephew, Darrel, gave it to you. I
thought that Guffey and you might be one and the same
person, and that’s why I was willing to bear with Jode
for a while longer, and see what I could make out of
his desire to get a new coach for Gold Hill. Tell me
about that forgery, and do it quick. The truth, mind!”</p>

<p>“What will you do to me if I—I tell the truth?” quavered
Shoup.</p>

<p>“Nothing, but if you lie I’ll see to it that you’re landed
behind the bars.”</p>

<p>“And you’ll let that thirty dollars pass?” asked Shoup,
looking toward Merriwell.</p>

<p>“I’ve already told you I would—if you tell the truth,”
Merry answered.</p>

<p>“Well, here goes, then. I was a fool for ever coming
back here, but Darrel had shown up and Lenning was
scared, and wanted to do something to get rid of him.
So I came on, when Lenning wired. I happen to be a
fair football coach, and that was Lenning’s excuse for
getting me here. But the main object of this trip, just
as of the one before, was to do up Darrel.”</p>

<p>“Why did Jode want his half brother ‘done up’?” cut
in the colonel.</p>

<p>“Why, Jode wanted all your property for himself,”
answered Shoup, an ugly smile on his pasty face, “and
that was his principal reason for wanting to get Darrel
out of the way.”</p>

<p>“Go on,” said the colonel, between his teeth; “tell us
about the forgery.”</p>

<p>“Jode planned it,” explained Shoup,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_313">313</span> “and furnished the
forged check. I was to get Darrel into a game, dope his
drink, and then accuse him of having given me the forged
check. That’s the way it worked. Darrel was hazy
and couldn’t remember what he’d done. Jode, of course,
was at home with you, colonel, so you hadn’t a notion
he was mixed up in it.”</p>

<p>“You’re a black-hearted scoundrel,” said the colonel,
“but Jode Lenning is a whole lot worse. What have you
to say, young man?” and he turned on his cowering and
discredited nephew with gleaming eyes.</p>

<p>Jode tried to talk, but words failed him. He began
to whimper.</p>

<p>“Is it true, what this fellow Shoup has told me?” thundered
the colonel.</p>

<p>“Y-yes,” Jode answered.</p>

<p>“I already knew you were a coward,” said the colonel,
“and I was tempted to think you were a knave as well,
but I couldn’t be sure. It was necessary first to catch
Shoup, and wring a confession from him. I thought,
when you were so eager to have this Guffey come to
Gold Hill, that he might be Shoup. Something in your
manner aroused my suspicions. That is why I let the
fellow come. To-day I asked Merriwell to coöperate
with me and see what we could learn from the Gold Hill
coach. Merriwell’s work surpassed my hopes and expectations.
He made a star play, and, as a result, has
cleared the name of his chum of every stain. As for
you, Lenning, clear out. I’m done with you for good!
I——”</p>

<p>Darrel caught his uncle’s sleeve, drew his head down,
and whispered to him earnestly. The colonel shook his
head, but Ellis continued to insist, and finally his uncle
yielded.</p>

<p>“Ellis asks me to temper my indignation a little,” said
he,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_314">314</span> “and to be a little more lenient. His motive does
him credit, after the way he has suffered at your hands,
Jode. You can go to my house and collect your traps;
and, when you leave, I will give you a thousand dollars
to make a fresh start in the world. Now, clear out!
You go with him, Shoup!” he added.</p>

<p>Jode got up and staggered from the room. Shoup
followed him, turning at the door to laugh derisively,
and bid those in the room a mocking good-by.</p>

<p>“Sufferin’ horn toads!” muttered Hawkins, “that’s no
way to treat a law breaker.”</p>

<p>“Better that, Hawkins,” answered the colonel, “than
to put Shoup through for his crimes and not get the evidence
to clear Darrel. My lad, will you now honor me
with your hand?”</p>

<p>Darrel pressed the colonel’s palm joyfully, and then
whirled to shake hands with Merriwell.</p>

<p>“You’re the one who did it, old man!” he exclaimed,
in a trembling voice. “If it hadn’t been for you, Chip,
I’d still be the ‘boy from Nowhere.’”</p>

<div class="small">
<p>The following list does not contain all the books that Horatio Alger
wrote, but it contains most of them, and certainly the best.</p>

<p>Horatio Alger is to boys what Charles Dickens is to grown-ups. His
work is just as popular to-day as it was years ago. The books have
a quality, the value of which is beyond computation.</p>

<p>There are legions of boys of foreign parents who are being helped
along the road to true Americanism by reading these books which are
so peculiarly American in tone that the reader cannot fail to absorb
some of the spirit of fair play and clean living which is so characteristically
American.</p>

<p>In this list will be included certain books by Edward Stratemeyer,
Oliver Optic, and other authors who wrote the Alger type of stories,
which are equal in interest and wholesomeness with those written by
the famous author after whom this great line of books for boys is
named.</p>

<h3>VALUE</h3>


<p>Although literature is generally regarded as
more or less of a luxury, there is such a thing
as getting your money’s worth, and a little more,
in the way of literature.</p>

<p>For seventy years the firm of STREET &amp;
SMITH has specialized in the publication of
fiction. During all this time everything bearing
our imprint represented good value for the
money.</p>

<p>When, about thirty years ago, we began the
publication of a series of paper bound books,
which has since become world famous by the
name of “The S &amp; S Novel,” we did our best
to publish the right sort of fiction. The sales
of these books proved that we have succeeded in
interesting and pleasing the American reading
public.</p>

<p>There are over 1,800 different titles in our
catalogue, and every title above reproach from
every standpoint. The STREET &amp; SMITH
NOVEL has been rightly called the fiction of
the masses.</p>

<p>Do not be deceived by books which look like
the STREET &amp; SMITH NOVELS but which
are made like them only in looks. Insist upon
having paper covered books bearing the imprint
of STREET &amp; SMITH, and so be sure of
securing full value for your money.</p>
